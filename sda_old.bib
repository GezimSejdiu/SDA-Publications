  Abstract                 = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured datasets on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and even extracted data of relatively low quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, which comprises of a manual and a semi-automatic process. The first phase includes the detection of common quality problems and their representation in a quality problem taxonomy. In the manual process, the second phase comprises of the evaluation of a large number of individual resources, according to the quality problem taxonomy via crowdsourcing. This process is accompanied by a tool wherein a user assesses an individual resource and evaluates each fact for correctness. The semi-automatic process involves the generation and verification of schema axioms. We report the results obtained by applying this methodology to DBpedia. We identified 17 data quality problem types and 58 users assessed a total of 521 resources. Overall, 11.93\% of the evaluated DBpedia triples were identified to have some quality issues. Applying the semi-automatic component yielded a total of 222,982 triples that have a high probability to be incorrect. In particular, we found that problems such as object values being incorrectly extracted, irrelevant extraction of information and broken links were the most recurring quality problems. With this study, we not only aim to assess the quality of this sample of DBpedia resources but also adopt an agile methodology to improve the quality in future versions by regularly providing feedback to the DBpedia maintainers.},

We analyzed the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources and classified them according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to a specific crowdsourcing approach. Based on this analysis, we implemented and compared two quality assessment methods for Linked Data that leverage the wisdom of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest format targeting an expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluated the two methods empirically in terms of their capacity to spot quality issues in DBpedia and investigated how the contributions of the two crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation processes. The results showed that the two styles of crowdsourcing are complementary, and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Author ranking is growing in popularity since search engines are considering the author's reputation of a Web page when generating search results. A question that naturally arises is whether we should rank authors on the Web as we rank Web pages by considering their links. In addition, over what links to actually calculate author ranking? We have adopted an extended FOAF ontology, the so-called Co-AuthorOnto ontology, able to represent authors, but also their co-author links on the Web. We further extended Co-AuthorOnto with PageRank and AuthorRank metrics for ranking authors based on their co-author links. Important to note is that both PageRank and AuthorRank are implemented in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which represents a novelty and fits well with the semantic modeling of authors and their co-author relationships within FOAF. Preliminary semantic ranking results are demonstrated, showcasing also the huge potential of this ranking approach for adopting it by search engines where our future work will focus.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decades the Web has evolved from a human--human communication network to a network of complex human--machine interactions.
An increasing amount of data is available as Linked Data which allows machines to “understand” the data, but RDF is not meant to be understood by humans.
With Jekyll RDF we present a method to close the gap between structured data and human accessible exploration interfaces by publishing RDF datasets as customizable static HTML sites.
It consists of an RDF resource mapping system to serve the resources under their respective IRI, a template mapping based on schema classes, and a markup language to define templates to render customized resource pages.
Using the template system, it is possible to create domain specific browsing interfaces for RDF data next to the Linked Data resources.
This enables content management and knowledge management systems to serve datasets in a highly customizable, low effort, and scalable way to be consumed by machines as well as humans.},

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety. While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected. We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples). In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this system paper, we describe the DL-Learner framework, which supports supervised machine learning using \{OWL\} and \{RDF\} for background knowledge representation. It can be beneficial in various data and schema analysis tasks with applications in different standard machine learning scenarios, e.g. in the life sciences, as well as Semantic Web specific applications such as ontology learning and enrichment. Since its creation in 2007, it has become the main \{OWL\} and RDF-based software framework for supervised structured machine learning and includes several algorithm implementations, usage examples and has applications building on top of the framework. The article gives an overview of the framework with a focus on algorithms and use cases.},

On the other hand, the Web of Science consists of high quality information created and reviewed by the international community of researchers. While it is a complicated process to switch from traditional publishing methods to methods, which enable data publishing in machine-readable formats, the situation can be improved by at least exposing metadata about the scientific publications in machine-readable format. In this paper we aim at metadata, hidden inside universities' internal databases, reports and other hard to discover sources. We extend the VIVO ontology and create the VIVO+ ontology. We define and describe a framework for automatic conversion of university data to RDF. We showcase the VIVO+ ontology and the framework using the example of the ITMO university.},

The lack of such insights hinders important data management tasks such as quality, privacy and coverage analysis. In this paper, we present LODStats, which provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of a significant part of the Data Web. LODStats integrates RDF datasets from data.gov, publicdata.eu and datahub.io data catalogs and at the time of writing lists over 9 000 RDF datasets. For each RDF dataset, LODStats collects comprehensive statistics and makes these available in adhering to the LDSO vocabulary. This analysis has been regularly published and enhanced over the past four years at the public platform lodstats.aksw.org. We give a comprehensive overview over the resulting dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite recent efforts to achieve a high level of interoperability of Machine Learning (ML) experiments, positively collaborating with the Reproducible Research context, we still run into the problems created due to the existence of different ML platforms: each of those have a specific conceptualization or schema for representing data and metadata. This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decades many machine learning experiments have been published, giving benefit to the scientific progress. In order to compare machine-learning experiment results with each other and collaborate positively, they need to be performed thoroughly on the same computing environment, using the same sample datasets and algorithm configurations. Besides this, practical experience shows that scientists and engineers tend to have large output data in their experiments, which is both difficult to analyze and archive properly without provenance metadata. However, the Linked Data community still misses a light-weight specification for interchanging machine-learning metadata over different architectures to achieve a higher level of interoperability. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel vocabulary dubbed MEX. We show that MEX provides a prompt method to describe experiments with a special focus on data provenance and fulfills the requirements for a long-term maintenance.},

We argue that such a system needs support for all concepts of the RDF specification including support for RDF datasets and blank nodes. Furthermore, we placed special emphasis on the protection against unperceived history manipulation by hashing the resulting patches. In addition to the conceptual analysis and an RDF vocabulary for representing versioning information, we present a mature implementation which captures versioning information for changes to arbitrary RDF datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Event data is increasingly being represented according to the Linked Data principles. The need for large-scale machine learning on data represented in this format has thus led to the need for efficient approaches to compute RDF links between resources based on their temporal properties. Time-efficient approaches for computing links between RDF resources have been developed over the last years. However, dedicated approaches for linking resources based on temporal relations have been paid little attention to. In this paper, we address this research gap by presenting A EGLE , a novel approach for the efficient computation of links between events according to Allen's interval algebra. We study Allen's relations and show that we can reduce all thirteen relations to eights simpler relations. We then present an efficient algorithm with a complexity of O(n log n) for computing these eight relations. Our evaluation of the runtime of our algorithms shows that we outperform the state of the art by up to 4 orders of magnitude while maintaining a precision and a recall of 100\%.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main tasks when creating and maintaining knowledge bases is to validate facts and provide sources for them in order to ensure correctness and traceability of the provided knowledge. So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents.In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) - an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a high public demand to increase transparency in government spending. Open spending data has the power to reduce corruption by increasing accountability and strengthens democracy because voters can make better informed decisions. An informed and trusting public also strengthens the government itself because it is more likely to commit to large projects. OpenSpending.org is a an open platform that provides public finance data from governments around the world. In this article, we present its RDF conversion LinkedSpending which provides more than five million planned and carried out financial transactions in 627 datasets from all over the world from 2005 to 2035 as Linked Open Data. This data is represented in the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and is freely available and openly licensed.},

  Abstract                 = {Interlinking knowledge bases are widely recognized as an important, but challenging problem. A significant amount of research has been undertaken to provide solutions to this problem with varying degrees of automation and user involvement. In this paper, we present a two-staged experiment for the creation of gold standards that act as benchmarks for several interlinking algorithms. In the first stage the gold standards are generated through manual validation process highlighting the role of users. Using the gold standards obtained from this stage, we assess the performance of human evaluators in addition to supervised interlinking algorithms. We evaluate our approach on several data interlinking tasks with respect to precision, recall and F-measure. Additionally we perform a qualitative analysis on the types of errors made by humans and machines.},

  Abstract                 = {We are currently observing a plethora of Natural Language Processing tools and services being made available. Each of the tools and services has its particular strengths and weaknesses, but exploiting the strengths and synergistically combining different tools is currently an extremely cumbersome and time consuming task. Also, once a particular set of tools is integrated, this integration is not reusable by others. We argue that simplifying the interoperability of different NLP tools performing similar but also complementary tasks will facilitate the comparability of results and the creation of sophisticated NLP applications. In this paper, we present the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). NIF is based on a Linked Data enabled URI scheme for identifying elements in (hyper-)texts and an ontology for describing common NLP terms and concepts. In contrast to more centralized solutions such as UIMA and GATE, NIF enables the creation of heterogeneous, distributed and loosely coupled NLP applications, which use the Web as an integration platform. We present several use cases of the second version of the NIF specification (NIF 2.0) and the result of a developer study.},

We present Databugger, a framework for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. Databugger ensures a basic level of quality by accompanying vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases with a number of test cases. The formalization behind the tool employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test queries. The test queries can be instantiated automatically based on a vocabulary or manually based on the data semantics. One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured data on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowd-sourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present a methodology for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. We argue, that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with LOV. One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major research challenge today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most analytics approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e., can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simple feature-vector-based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, analytics methods which exploit expressive structures usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases. This software framework paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which supports expressive and scalable semantic analytics by providing functionality for distributed in-memory computing for RDF data. The library provides APIs for RDF storage, querying using SPARQL and forward chaining inference. It includes several machine learning algorithms for RDF knowledge graphs. The article describes the vision, architecture and use cases of SANSA.},

During the project, several development efforts were made, whose results either facilitate the exploration and visualization directly (such as OntoWiki, the Pivot Browser) or can be used to support such tasks. In this chapter we present the three selected solutions rsine, CubeViz and Facete.},

In this demo we present the CubeViz visualization architecture and components, sketch its underlying API and the libraries used to generate the desired output. By employing advanced introspection, analysis and visualization bootstrapping techniques CubeViz hides the schema complexity of the encoded data in order to support a user-friendly exploration experience.},

  Abstract                 = {The Financial Transparency System (FTS) of the European Commission contains information about grants for European Union projects starting from 2007. It allows users to get an overview on EU funding, including information on beneficiaries as well as the amount and type of expenditure and information on the responsible EU department. The original dataset is freely available on the European Commission website, where users can query the data using an HTML form and download it in CSV and most recently XML format. In this article, we describe the transformation of this data to RDF and its interlinking with other datasets. We show that this allows interesting queries over the data, which were very difficult without this conversion. The main benefit of the dataset is an increased financial transparency of EU project funding. The RDF version of the FTS dataset will become part of the EU Open Data Portal and eventually be hosted and maintained by the European Union itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Providing accurate approaches for keyword search or question answering to access the data available on the Linked Data Web is of central importance to ensure that it can be used by non-experts. In many cases, these approaches return a large number of results that need to be provided in the right order so as to be of relevance to the user. Achieving the goal of improving the access to the Linked Data Web thus demands the provision of ranking approaches that allow sorting potentially large number of results appropriately. While such functions have been designed in previous works, they have not been evaluated exhaustively. This work addresses this research gap by proposing a formal framework designed towards comparing and evaluating different ranking functions for RDF data. The framework allows combining these rankings by means of an extension of the Spearman's footrule estimation of the upper bound of this function. We supply a benchmark with a total of 60 manually annotated entity ranks by users from USA and India recruited over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Moreover, we evaluated nine entity ranking functions over the proposed benchmark.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose - DBpedia extracts structured information from Wikipedia, interlinks it with other knowledge bases and freely publishes the results on the Web using Linked Data and SPARQL. However, the DBpedia release process is heavy-weight and releases are sometimes based on several months old data. DBpedia-Live solves this problem by providing a live synchronization method based on the update stream of Wikipedia. Design/methodology/approach - Wikipedia provides DBpedia with a continuous stream of updates, i.e. a stream of recently updated articles. DBpedia-Live processes that stream on the fly to obtain RDF data and stores the extracted data back to DBpedia. DBpedia-Live publishes the newly added/deleted triples in files, in order to enable synchronization between our DBpedia endpoint and other DBpedia mirrors. Findings - During the realization of DBpedia-Live we learned, that it is crucial to process Wikipedia updates in a priority queue. Recently-updated Wikipedia articles should have the highest priority, over mapping-changes and unmodified pages. An overall finding is that there is a plenty of opportunities arising from the emerging Web of Data for librarians. Practical implications - DBpedia had and has a great effect on the Web of Data and became a crystallization point for it. Many companies and researchers use DBpedia and its public services to improve their applications and research approaches. The DBpedia-Live framework improves DBpedia further by timely synchronizing it with Wikipedia, which is relevant for many use cases requiring up-to-date information. Originality/value - The new DBpedia-Live framework adds new features to the old DBpedia-Live framework, e.g. abstract extraction, ontology changes, and changesets publication.},

  Abstract                 = {Presently, an amount of publications in Machine Learning and Data Mining contexts are contributing to the improvement of algorithms and methods in their respective fields. However, with regard to publication and sharing of scientific experiment achievements, we still face problems on searching and ranking these methods. Scouring the Internet to search state-of-the-art information about specific contexts, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), is often a time-consuming task. Besides, this process can lead to an incomplete investigation, either because search engines may return incomplete information or keywords may not be properly defined. To bridge this gap, we present WASOTA, a web portal specifically designed to share and readily present metadata about the state of the art on a specific domains, making the process of searching this information easier.},

  Abstract                 = {The Linked Data Web has developed into a compendium of partly very large datasets. Devising efficient approaches to compute links between these datasets is thus central to achieve the vision behind the Data Web. Several unsupervised approaches have been developed to achieve this goal. Yet, so far, none of these approaches makes use of the replication of resources across several knowledge bases to improve the accuracy it achieves while linking. In this paper, we present Colibri, an iterative unsupervised approach for link discovery. Colibri allows discovering links between n datasets (n ??????? 2) while improving the quality of the instance data in these datasets. To this end, Colibri combines error detection and correction with unsupervised link discovery. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets with respect to the F-score itachieves. Our results suggest that Colibri can significantly improve the results of unsupervised machine-learning approaches for link discovery while correctly detecting erroneous resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Supply Chain Management aims at optimizing the flow of goods and services from the producer to the consumer. Closely interconnected enterprises that align their production, logistics and procurement with one another thus enjoy a competitive advantage in the market. To achieve a close alignment, an instant, robust and efficient information flow along the supply chain between and within enterprises is required. However, less efficient human communication is often used instead of automatic systems because of the great diversity of enterprise systems and models. This paper describes an approach and its implementation SCM Intelligence App, which enables the configuration of individual supply chains together with the execution of industry accepted performance metrics. Based on machine-processable supply chain data model (the SCORVoc RDF vocabulary implementing the SCOR standard) and W3C standardized protocols such as SPARQL, the approach represents an alternative to closed software systems, which lack support for inter-organizational supply chain analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach using a prototypical implementation and a test scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely accepted that food supply and quality are major problems in the 21st century. Due to the growth of the world's population, there is a pressing need to improve the productivity of agricultural crops, which hinges on different factors such as geographical location, soil type, weather condition and particular attributes of the crops to plant. In many regions of the world, information about those factors is not readily accessible and dispersed across a multitude of different sources. One of those regions is Nepal, in which the lack of access to this knowledge poses a significant burden for agricultural planning and decision making. Making such knowledge more accessible can boot up a farmer's living standard and increase their competitiveness on national and global markets. In this article, we show how we converted several available, although not easily accessible, datasets to RDF, thereby lowering the barrier for data re-usage and integration. We describe the conversion, linking, and publication process as well as use cases, which can be implemented using the farming datasets in Nepal.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last years, the Semantic Web has been growing steadily. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards.
Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may not take the full advantage of the data without having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage.
In fact, there are already a number of tools, which offer such statistics, providing basic information about RDF datasets and vocabularies.
However, those usually show severe deficiencies in terms of performance once the dataset size grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine.
In this paper, we introduce a software component for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines.
More specifically, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark.
The preliminary results show that our distributed approach improves upon a previous centralized approach we compare against and provides approximately linear horizontal scale-up.
The criteria are extensible beyond the 32 default criteria, is integrated into the larger SANSA framework and employed in at least four major usage scenarios beyond the SANSA community.},

Query expansion methods augment the original query of a user with alternative query elements with similar meaning to increase the chance of retrieving appropriate resources. In this work, we introduce a number of new query expansion features based on semantic and linguistic inferencing over Linked Open Data. We evaluate the effectiveness of each feature individually as well as their combinations employing several machine learning approaches. The evaluation is carried out on a training dataset extracted from the QALD Question Answering benchmark. Furthermore, we propose an optimized linear combination of linguistic and lightweight semantic features in order to predict the usefulness of each expansion candidate. Our experimental study shows a considerable improvement in precision and recall over baseline approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant portion of the evolution of Linked Data datasets lies in updating the links to other datasets. An important challenge when aiming to update these links automatically under the open-world assumption is the fact that usually only positive examples for the links exist. We address this challenge by presenting and evaluating WOMBAT , a novel approach for the discovery of links between knowledge bases that relies exclusively on positive examples. WOMBAT is based on generalisation via an upward refinement operator to traverse the space of link specification. We study the theoretical characteristics of WOMBAT and evaluate it on 8 different benchmark datasets. Our evaluation suggests that WOMBAT outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches while relying on less information. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that WOMBAT ????????s pruning algorithm allows it to scale well even on large datasets.},

Currently, this problem is most commonly addressed by manually devising means of enriching an input dataset. The few tools that aim at supporting this endeavour usually focus on supporting the manual definition of enrichment pipelines. In this paper, we present a supervised learning approach based on a refinement operator for enriching RDF datasets. We show how we can use exemplary descriptions of enriched resources to generate accurate enrichment pipelines. We evaluate our approach against eight manually defined enrichment pipelines and show that our approach can learn accurate pipelines even when provided with a small number of training examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Large amounts of geo-spatial information have been made available with the growth of the Web of Data. While discovering links between resources on the Web of Data has been shown to be a demanding task, discovering links between geo-spatial resources proves to be even more challenging. This is partly due to the resources being described by the means of vector geometry. Especially, discrepancies in granularity and error measurements across data sets render the selection of appropriate distance measures for geo-spatial resources difficult. In this paper, we survey existing literature for point-set measures that can be used to measure the similarity of vector geometries. We then present and evaluate the ten measures that we derived from literature. We evaluate these measures with respect to their time-efficiency and their robustness against discrepancies in measurement and in granularity. To this end, we use samples of real data sets of different granularity as input for our evaluation framework. The results obtained on three different data sets suggest that most distance approaches can be led to scale. Moreover, while some distance measures are significantly slower than other measures, distance measure based on means, surjections and sums of minimal distances are robust against the different types of discrepancies.},

  Abstract                 = {Many of the available RDF datasets describe millions of resources by using billions of triples. Consequently, millions of links can potentially exist among such datasets. While parallel implementations of link discovery approaches have been developed in the past, load balancing approaches for local implementations of link discovery algorithms have been paid little attention to. In this paper, we thus present a novel load balancing technique for link discovery on parallel hardware based on particle-swarm optimization. We combine this approach with the Orchid algorithm for geo-spatial linking and evaluate it on real and artificial datasets. Our evaluation suggests that while na{\"i}ve approaches can be super-linear on small data sets, our deterministic particle swarm optimization outperforms both na{\"i}ve and classical load balancing approaches such as greedy load balancing on large datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {While several tools for simplifying the task of visualizing (SPARQL accessible) RDF data on the Web are available today, there is a lack of corresponding tools for exploiting standard HTML forms directly for RDF editing. The few related existing systems roughly fall in the categories of (a) applications that are not aimed at being reused as components, (b) form generators, which automatically create forms from a given schema -- possibly derived from instance data -- or (c) form template processors which create forms from a manually created specification. Furthermore, these systems usually come with their own widget library, which can only be extended by wrapping existing widgets. In this paper, we present the AngularJS-based \emph{Rdf Edit eXtension} (REX) system, which facilitates the enhancement of standard HTML forms as well as many existing AngularJS widgets with RDF editing support by means of a set of HTML attributes. We demonstrate our system though the realization of several usage scenarios.},

Their users add or edit up to 150 thousand wiki pages per day. The DBpedia project extracts RDF from Wikipedia and interlinks it with other knowledge bases. In the DBpedia live extraction mode, Wikipedia edits are instantly processed to update information in DBpedia. Due to the high number of edits and the growth of Wikipedia, the update process has to be very efficient and scalable. In this paper, we present different strategies to tackle this challenging problem and describe how we modified the DBpedia live extraction algorithm to work more efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of the advantages of widely used relational databases and semantic technologies has attracted significant research over the past decade. In particular, mapping languages for the conversion of databases to RDF knowledge bases have been developed and standardized in the form of R2RML. In this article, we first review those mapping languages and then devise work towards a unified formal model for them. Based on this, we present the Sparqlification Mapping Language (SML), which provides an intuitive way to declare mappings based on SQL VIEWS and SPARQL construct queries. We show that SML has the same expressivity as R2RML by enumerating the language features and show the correspondences, and we outline how one syntax can be converted into the other. A conducted user study for this paper juxtaposing SML and R2RML provides evidence that SML is a more compact syntax which is easier to understand and read and thus lowers the barrier to offer SPARQL access to relational databases.},

  Abstract                 = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured datasets on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and even extracted data of relatively low quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, which comprises of a manual and a semi-automatic process. The first phase includes the detection of common quality problems and their representation in a quality problem taxonomy. In the manual process, the second phase comprises of the evaluation of a large number of individual resources, according to the quality problem taxonomy via crowdsourcing. This process is accompanied by a tool wherein a user assesses an individual resource and evaluates each fact for correctness. The semi-automatic process involves the generation and verification of schema axioms. We report the results obtained by applying this methodology to DBpedia. We identified 17 data quality problem types and 58 users assessed a total of 521 resources. Overall, 11.93\% of the evaluated DBpedia triples were identified to have some quality issues. Applying the semi-automatic component yielded a total of 222,982 triples that have a high probability to be incorrect. In particular, we found that problems such as object values being incorrectly extracted, irrelevant extraction of information and broken links were the most recurring quality problems. With this study, we not only aim to assess the quality of this sample of DBpedia resources but also adopt an agile methodology to improve the quality in future versions by regularly providing feedback to the DBpedia maintainers.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognition is determined by function and interplay of several hundred if not thousand genes with a considerable overlap in the phenotypes and genes causing different cognitive diseases. We argue that these diseases should not be studied in isolation, but that data allowing to study them should be integrated. Ultimately, this will allow researchers to more easily answer questions, which would otherwise require time-consuming research. Specifically, we propose to use Linked Data publication, data integration and querying methods, which has been successfully used in other life science domains. In this initial effort, we converted 12 different datasets, integrate them and provide a first demonstration of the added value by showing how a set of relevant queries over the integrated data can be answered.},
