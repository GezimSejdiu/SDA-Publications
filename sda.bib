abstract = {The open data movement within public administrations has provided data regarding governance publicly. As public administrators and governments produce data and release the data as open data, the volume of the data is highly increasing. One of these datasets is budget and spending data, which has been gaining interest to the extent that several working groups and CSO/NGOs started working on this particular open data domain. The majority of these datasets are part of the open budget and spending datasets, which laid out data regarding how public administrations plan, revise, allocate, and expense their governance funding. The disclosure of public administration budget and spending data is expected to improve governance transparency, accountability, law enforcement, and political participation. 

Unfortunately, the analysis of budget and spending datasets is not a trivial task to do for several reasons. First, the quality of open fiscal data varies. Standards and recommendations for publishing open data are available, however, these standards are often not met and no framework specifically addresses fiscal data quality measurements. Second, the datasets are heterogeneous, since it is produced by different public administrations with different business process, accounting practice, requirements, and language. This lead to a challenging task in data integration across public budget and spending data. The structural and linguistic heterogeneity of open budget and spending data makes comparative analysis across datasets difficult to perform. Third, datasets within the budget and spending domain are complicated. To be able to comprehend such data, expertise is needed both from the public accounting/budgeting domain, as well as the technical domain to digest the datasets properly. Fourth, a platform to transform, store, analyze, and visualize datasets is necessary, especially those that make the utilization of semantic analysis is possible. Fifth, there is no conceptual association between datasets, which can be used as a comparison point to analyze fiscal records between compared public administrations. Lastly, there is a lack of methodology to consume and compare linked open fiscal data records across different public administrations. 

Our focus in this thesis is hence to perform research to help the community gain a better understanding of open fiscal data, provide analysis of their quality, suggest a way to publish open fiscal data in an improved manner, analyze the open fiscal data heterogeneity while also laying out lessons learned regarding their current state and supporting data formats that are capable for open fiscal data integration. Consequently, a platform to digest, analyze and visualize these datasets is devised, continued with performing experiments on multilingual fiscal data concept mapping and wrapped up with a proof-of-concept description of comparative analysis over linked open fiscal data.

abstract = {The ubiquitous availability of the Internet results in a massive number of apps, software, and online services with accompanying contractual agreements in the form of end-user license agreement' andprivacy policy’. Often the textual documents describing rights, policies, and conditions comprise many pages and can not be reasonably assumed to be read and understood by humans. Although everyone is exposed to such consent forms, the majority tend to ignore them due to their length and complexity. However, the cost of ignoring terms and conditions is not always negligible, and occasionally people have to pay (money or other means) as a result of their oversight. In this thesis, we focus on the interpretation of contractual agreements for the benefit of end-users. Contractual agreements encompass both the privacy policies and the general terms and conditions related to software and services. The main characteristics of such agreements are their use of legal terminologies and limited vocabulary. This feature has pros and cons. On one hand, the clear structure and legal language facilitate the mapping between the human-readable agreements and machine-processable concepts. On the other hand, the legal terminologies make the contractual agreement complex, subjective, and, therefore, open to interpretation. This thesis addresses the problem of contractual agreement analysis from both perspectives. In order to provide a structured presentation of contractual agreements, we apply text mining and semantic technologies to develop approaches that extract important information from the agreements and retrieve helpful links and resources for better comprehension. Our approaches are based on ontology-based information extraction, machine learning, and semantic similarity and aim to deliver tedious consent forms in a user friendly and visualized format. The ontology-based information extraction approach processes the human-readable license agreement guided by a domain ontology to extract deontic modalities and presents a summarized output to the end-user. In the extraction phase, we focus on three key rights and conditions: permission, prohibition, duty and cluster the extracted excerpts according to their similarities. The clustering is based on semantic similarity employing a distributional semantics approach on large word embeddings database. The machine learning method employs deep neural networks to classify a privacy policy’s paragraphs into pre-defined categories. Since the prediction results of the trained model are promising, we further use the predicted classes to assign five risk colors (Green, Yellow, Red) to five privacy icons (Expected Use, Expected Collection, Precise Location, Data Retention and Children Privacy). Furthermore, given that any contractual agreement must comply with the relevant legislation, we utilize text semantic similarity to map an agreement’s content to regulatory documents. The semantic similarity-based approach finds candidate sentences in an agreement that are potentially related to specific articles in the regulation. Then, for each candidate sentence, the relevant article and provision is found according to their semantic similarity. The achieved results from our proposed approaches allow us to conclude that although semi-automatic approaches lead to information loss, they save time and effort by producing instant results and facilitate the end-users understanding of legal texts.},

abstract = {Web technologies have substantially stimulated the submission of manuscripts, publishing scientific articles, as well as the organization of scholarly events, especially virtual events, when a global crisis occurs, which consequently restricts travels across the globe. Publication in scholarly events, such as conferences, workshops, and symposiums, is essential and pervasive in computer science, engineering, and natural sciences. The past years have witnessed significant growth in scholarly data published on the Web, mostly in unstructured formats, which immolate the embedded semantics and relationships between various entities. These formats restrict the reusability of the data, i.e., data analysis, retrieval, and mining. Therefore, managing, retrieving, and analyzing such data have become quite challenging. Consequently, there is a pressing need to represent this data in a semantic format, i.e., Linked Data, which significantly improves scholarly communication by supporting researchers concerning analyzing, retrieving, and exploring scholarly data. Notwithstanding the considerable advances in technology, publishing and exchanging scholarly data have not substantially changed (i.e., still follows the document-based scheme), thus restricting both developments of research applications in various industries as well as data preservation and exploration. This thesis tackles the problem of facilitating scholarly communication using semantic technologies. The ultimate aim is improving scholarly communication by facilitating the transformation from a document-based to knowledge-based scholarly communication, which helps researchers to examine science itself with a new perspective. Key steps towards the goal have been taken by proposing methodologies as well as a metrics suite for publishing and assessing the quality of scholarly events concerning several criteria, in particular, Computer Science as well as Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering. Within the framework of these criteria, steps towards assessing the quality of scholarly events and recommendations to various stakeholders have been taken. Furthermore, we engineered the Scientific Events Ontology in order to enable the enriched semantic representation of scholarly event metadata. Currently, this ontology is in use on thousands of OpenResearch.org events wiki pages. These steps will have far-reaching implications for the various stakeholders involved in the scholarly communication domain, including authors, sponsors, reviewers, publishers, and libraries. Most of the scholarly data publishers, such as Springer Nature, have taken serious steps towards publishing research data in a semantic form by publishing collated information from across the research landscape, such as research articles, scholarly events, persons, and grants, as knowledge graphs. Interlinking this data will significantly enable the provision of better and more intelligent services for the discovery of scientific work, which opens new opportunities for both scholarly data exploration and analysis. In the direction to this goal, we proposed the Science Knowledge Graph Ontologies suite, which comprises four OWL ontologies for representing the scientific knowledge in various fields of science, including Computer Science, Physics, and Pharmaceutical science. Besides, we developed an upper ontology on top of them for modeling modern science branches and related concepts, such as scientific discovery, instruments, and phenomena.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, Knowledge Graphs (KG) have emerged as a prominent repository for storing facts about the world in a linked data architecture. Providing machines with the capability of exploring such Knowledge Graphs and answering natural language questions over them, has been an active area of research. The purpose of this work, is to delve further into the research of retrieving information stored in KGs, based on the natural language questions posed by the user. Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to produce a concise answer to a user question, such that the user is exempt from using KG vocabulary and overheads of learning a formal query language. Existing KGQA systems have achieved excellent results over Simple Questions, where the information required is limited to a single triple and a single formal query pattern. Our motivation is to improve the performance of KGQA over Complex Questions, where formal query patterns significantly vary, and a single triple is not confining for all the required information. Complex KGQA provides several challenges such as understanding semantics and syntactic structure of questions, Entity Linking, Relation Linking and Answer Representation. Lack of suitable datasets for complex question answering further adds to research gaps. Hence, in this thesis, we focus the research objective of laying the foundations for the advancement of the state-of-the-art for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs, by providing techniques to solve various challenges and provide resources to fill the research gaps. 
First, we propose Normalized Query Structure (NQS), which is a linguistic analyzer module that helps the QA system to detect inputs and intents and the relation between them in the users’ question. NQS acts like an intermediate language between natural language questions and formal expressions to ease the process of query formulation for complex questions. We then developed a framework named LC-QuAD to generate large scale question answering dataset by reversing the process of question answering, thereby translating natural language questions from the formal query using intermediate templates. Our goal is to use this framework for high variations in the query patterns and create a large size dataset with minimum human effort. The first version of the dataset consists of 5,000 complex questions. By extending the LC-QuAD framework to support Reified KGs and crowd-sourcing, we published the second version of the dataset as LC-QuAD 2.0, consisting of 30,000 questions with their paraphrases and has higher complexity and new variations in the questions. To overcome the problem of Entity Linking and Relation Linking in KGQA, we develop EARL, a module performing these two tasks as a single joint task for complex question answering. We develop approaches for this module, first by formalizing the task as an instance of the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) and the second approach uses machine learning to exploit the connection density between nodes in the Knowledge Graph. Lastly, we create another large scale dataset to answer verbalization and provide results for multiple baseline systems on it. The Verbalization dataset is introduced to make the system’s response more human-like. The NQS based KGQA system was next to the best system in terms of accuracy on the QALD-5 dataset. We empirically prove that NQS is robust to tackle paraphrases of the questions. EARL achieves the state of the art results in Entity Linking and Relation Linking for question answering on several KGQA datasets. The dataset curated in this thesis has helped the research community to move forward in the direction of improving the accuracy of complex question answering as a task as other researchers too developed several KGQA systems and modules around these published datasets. With the large-scale datasets, we have encouraged the use of large scale machine learning, deep learning and emergence of new techniques to advance the state-of-the-art in complex question answering over knowledge graphs. We further developed core components for the KGQA pipeline to overcome the challenges of Question Understanding, Entity-Relation Linking and Answer Verbalization and thus achieve our research objective. All the proposed approaches mentioned in this thesis and the published resources are available at https://github.com/AskNowQA and are released under the umbrella project AskNow.},

abstract = {The remarkable advances achieved in both research and development of Data Management as well as the prevalence of high-speed Internet and technology in the last few decades have caused unprecedented data avalanche. Large volumes of data manifested in a multitude of types and formats are being generated and becoming the new norm. In this context, it is crucial to both leverage existing approaches and propose novel ones to overcome this data size and complexity, and thus facilitate data exploitation. In this thesis, we investigate two major approaches to addressing this challenge: Physical Data Integration and Logical Data Integration. The specific problem tackled is to enable querying large and heterogeneous data sources in an ad hoc manner. 
In the Physical Data Integration, data is physically and wholly transformed into a canonical unique format, which can then be directly and uniformly queried. In the Logical Data Integration, data remains in its original format and form and a middleware is posed above the data allowing to map various schemata elements to a high-level unifying formal model. The latter enables the querying of the underlying original data in an ad hoc and uniform way, a framework which we call Semantic Data Lake, SDL. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the former, a significant effort and cost are devoted to pre-processing and transforming the data to the unified canonical format. In the latter, the cost is shifted to the query processing phases, e.g., query analysis, relevant source detection and results reconciliation. 
In this thesis we investigate both directions and study their strengths and weaknesses. For each direction, we propose a set of approaches and demonstrate their feasibility via a proposed implementation. In both directions, we appeal to Semantic Web technologies, which provide a set of time-proven techniques and standards that are dedicated to Data Integration. In the Physical Integration, we suggest an end-to-end blueprint for the semantification of large and heterogeneous data sources, i.e., physically transforming the data to the Semantic Web data standard RDF (Resource Description Framework). A unified data representation, storage and query interface over the data are suggested. In the Logical Integration, we provide a description of the SDL architecture, which allows querying data sources right on their original form and format without requiring a prior transformation and centralization. For a number of reasons that we detail, we put more emphasis on the virtual approach. We present the effort behind an extensible implementation of the SDL, called Squerall, which leverages state-of-the-art Semantic and Big Data technologies, e.g., RML (RDF Mapping Language) mappings, FnO (Function Ontology) ontology, and Apache Spark. A series of evaluation is conducted to evaluate the implementation along with various metrics and input data scales. In particular, we describe an industrial real-world use case using our SDL implementation. In a preparation phase, we conduct a survey for the Query Translation methods in order to back some of our design choices.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, the amount and availability of machine-readable Open, Linked, and Big data on the web has increased. Simultaneously, several data management systems have emerged to deal with the increased amounts of this structured data. RDF and Graph databases are two popular approaches for data management based on modeling, storing, and querying graph-like data. RDF database systems are based on the W3C standard RDF data model and use the W3C standard SPARQL as their defacto query language. Most graph database systems are based on the Property Graph (PG) data model and use the Gremlin language as their query language due to its popularity amongst vendors. Given that both of these approaches have distinct and complementary characteristics – RDF is suited for distributed data integration with built-in world-wide unique identifiers and vocabularies; PGs, on the other hand, support horizontally scalable storage and querying, and are widely used for modern data analytics applications, – it becomes necessary to support interoperability amongst them. The main objective of this dissertation is to study and address this interoperability issue. We identified three research challenges that are concerned with the data interoperability, query interoperability, and benchmarking of these databases. First, we tackle the data interoperability problem. We propose three direct mappings (schema-dependent and schema-independent) for transforming an RDF database into a property graph database. We show that the proposed mappings satisfy the desired properties of semantics preservation and information preservation. Based on our analysis (both formal and empirical), we argue that any RDF database can be transformed into a PG database using our approach. Second, we propose a novel approach for querying PG databases using SPARQL using Gremlin traversals – GREMLINATOR to tackle the query interoperability problem. In doing so, we first formalize the declarative constructs of Gremlin language using a consolidated graph relational algebra and define mappings to translate SPARQL queries into Gremlin traversals. GREMLINATOR has been officially integrated as a plugin for the Apache TinkerPop graph computing framework (as sparql-gremlin), which enables users to execute SPARQL queries over a wide variety of OLTP graph databases and OLAP graph processing frameworks. Finally, we tackle the third, benchmarking (performance evaluation), problem. We propose a novel framework – LITMUS Benchmark Suite that allows a choke-point driven performance comparison and analysis of various databases (PG and RDF-based) using various third-party real and synthetic datasets and queries. We also studied a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors – data and system-specific metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that influence a given system’s performance. LITMUS incorporates various memory, processor, data quality, indexing, query typology, and data-based metrics for providing a fine-grained evaluation of the benchmark. In conclusion, by filling the research gaps, addressed by this dissertation, we have laid a solid formal and practical foundation for supporting interoperability between the RDF and Property graph database technology stacks. The artifacts produced during the term of this dissertation have been integrated into various academic and industrial projects.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards. A major and yet unsolved challenge that research faces today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs in order to facilitate applications in various domains including life sciences, publishing, and the internet of things. The main objective of this thesis is to lay foundations for efficient algorithms performing analytics, i.e. exploration, quality assessment, and querying over semantic knowledge graphs at a scale that has not been possible before. First, we propose a novel approach for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines. In particular, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark. Many applications such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may take full advantage of the data when having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage. However, such applications may suffer from low quality and not being able to leverage the full advantage of the data when the size of data goes beyond the capacity of the resources available. Thus, we introduce a distributed approach of quality assessment of large RDF datasets. It is the first distributed, in-memory approach for computing different quality metrics for large RDF datasets using Apache Spark. We also provide a quality assessment pattern that can be used to generate new scalable metrics that can be applied to big data. Based on the knowledge of the internal statistics of a dataset and its quality, users typically want to query and retrieve large amounts of information. As a result, it has become difficult to efficiently process these large RDF datasets. Indeed, these processes require, both efficient storage strategies and query-processing engines, to be able to scale in terms of data size. Therefore, we propose a scalable approach to evaluate SPARQL queries over distributed RDF datasets by translating SPARQL queries into Spark executable code. We conducted several empirical evaluations to assess the scalability, effectiveness, and efficiency of our proposed approaches. More importantly, various use cases i.e. Ethereum analysis, Mining Big Data Logs, and Scalable Integration of POIs, have been developed and leverages by our approach. The empirical evaluations and concrete applications provide evidence that our methodology and techniques proposed during this thesis help to effectively analyze and process large-scale RDF datasets. All the proposed approaches during this thesis are integrated into the larger SANSA framework.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the Web provides an infrastructure to share all kinds of information which are easily accessible to humans around the world. Furthermore, the amount of information is growing rapidly and requires computing machines to process, comprehend, and extract useful information tailored for the end-users. The Semantic Web and semantic technologies play a prominent role to enable knowledge representation and reasoning for these computational processes. Semantic technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs are being used in various application domains, including data governance, knowledge management, chatbots, biology, etc., which aim at providing proper infrastructure to analyze the knowledge and reasoning for the computers. Semantic Question Answering systems are among the most desired platforms in recent years that facilitate access to information in knowledge graphs. They provide a natural language interface that permits the users to ask their questions posed in a natural language, without any understanding of the underlying technologies. We thus study question answering systems over knowledge graphs which aim to map an input question in natural language into a formal query, intending to retrieve a concise answer from the knowledge graph. This is a highly challenging task due to the intrinsic complexity of the natural language, such that the resulting query does not always accurately subserve the user intent, particularly, for more complex and less common questions.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web, a Web of Data, is an extension of the World Wide Web (WWW), a Web of Documents. A large amount of such data is freely available as Linked Open Data (LOD) for many areas of knowledge, forming the LOD Cloud. While this data conforms to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and can thus be processed by machines, users need to master a formal query language and learn a specific vocabulary. Semantic Question Answering (SQA) systems remove those access barriers by letting the user ask natural language questions that the systems translate into formal queries. Thus, the research area of SQA plays an important role for the acceptance and benefit of the Semantic Web. The original contributions of this thesis to SQA are: First, we survey the current state of the art of SQA. We complement existing surveys by systematically identifying SQA publications in the chosen timeframe. 72 publications describing 62 different systems are systematically and manually selected using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria out of 1960 candidates from the end of 2010 to July 2015. The survey identifies common challenges, structured solutions, and recommendations on research opportunities for future systems. From that point on, we focus on multidimensional numerical data, which is immensely valuable as it influences decisions in health care, policy and finance, among others. With the growth of the open data movement, more and more of it is becoming freely available. A large amount of such data is included in the LOD cloud using the RDF Data Cube (RDC) vocabulary. However, consuming multidimensional numerical data requires experts and specialized tools. Traditional SQA systems cannot process RDCs because their meta-structure is opaque to applications that expect facts to be encoded in single triples, This motivates our second contribution, the design and implementation of the first SQA algorithm on RDF Data Cubes. We kick-start this new research subfield by creating a user question corpus and a benchmark over multiple data sets. The evaluation of our system on the benchmark, which is included in the public Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) challenge of 2016, shows the feasibility of the approach, but also highlights challenges, which we discuss in detail as a starting point for future work in the field. The benchmark is based on our final contribution, the addition of 955 financial government spending data sets to the LOD cloud by transforming data sets of the OpenSpending project to RDF Data Cubes. Open spending data has the power to reduce corruption by increasing accountability and strengthens democracy because voters can make better informed decisions. An informed and trusting public also strengthens the government itself because it is more likely to commit to large projects. OpenSpending.org is an open platform that provides public finance data from governments around the world. The transformation result, called Linked Spending, consists of more than five million planned and carried out financial transactions in 955 data sets from all over the world as Linked Open Data and is freely available and openly licensed.},

abstract = {Research is becoming increasingly digital, interdisciplinary, and data-driven and affects different en- vironments in addition to academia, such as industry, and government. Research output representation, publication, mining, analysis, and visualization are taken to a new level, driven by the increased use of Web standards and digital scholarly communication initiatives. The number of scientific publications produced by new players and the increasing digital availability of scholarly artifacts, and associated metadata are other drivers of the substantial growth in scholarly communication. The heterogeneity of scholarly artifacts and their metadata spread over different Web data sources poses a major challenge for researchers with regard to search, retrieval and exploration. For example, it has become difficult to keep track of relevant scientific results, to stay up-to-date with new scientific events and running projects, as well as to find potential future collaborators. Thus, assisting researchers with a broader integration, management, and analysis of scholarly metadata can lead to new opportunities in research and to new ways of conducting research. The data integration problem has been extensively addressed by communities in the Database, Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web fields. However, a share of the interoperability issues are domain specific and new challenges with regard to schema, structure, or domain, arise in the context of scholarly metadata integration. Thus, a method is needed to support scientific communities to integrate and manage heterogeneous scholarly metadata in order to derive insightful analysis (e.g., quality assessment of scholarly artifacts). This thesis tackles the problem of scholarly metadata integration and develops a life cycle methodology to facilitate the integrated use of different methods, analysis techniques, and tools for improving scholarly communication. Some key steps of the metadata life cycle are implemented using a collaborative platform, which allows to keep the research communities in the loop. In particular, the use of collaborative methods is beneficial for the acquisition, integration, curation and utilization of scholarly metadata. We conducted empirical evaluations to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Our metadata transformation from legacy resources achieves reasonable performance and results in better metadata maintainability. The interlinking of metadata enhances the coherence of scholarly information spaces both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our metadata analysis techniques provide a precise quality assessment of scholarly artifacts, taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, while maintaining compatibility with existing ranking systems. These empirical evaluations and the concrete applications with a particular focus on collaborative aspects demonstrate the benefits of integrating distributed scholarly metadata.},

abstract = {In recent years, misinformation has caused widespread alarm and has become a global concern, given the negative impact placed on society, democratic institutions and even computing systems whose primary objective is to serve as a reliable information channel, e.g., KnowledgeBases (KBs). The proliferation of fake news has a wide range of characteristics and different motivations. For instance, it can be produced unintentionally (e.g., the creation process of KBswhich is mostly based on automated information extraction methods, thus naturally error-prone)or intentionally (e.g., the spread of misinformation through social media to persuade). Thus, they differ considerably in complexity, structure and number of arguments and propositions. To further exacerbate this problem, an ever-increasing amount of fake news on the Web has created another challenge to drawing correct information. This huge sea of data makes it very difficult for human fact-checkers and journalists to assess all the information manually. Therefore, addressing this problem is of utmost importance to minimize real-world circumstances which may provoke a negative impact on society, in general. Presently, Fact-Checking has emerged as a branch of natural language processing devoted to achieving this feat. Under this umbrella, Automated Fact-Checking frameworks have been proposed to perform claim verification. However, given the nature of the problem, different tasks need to be performed, from natural language understanding to source trustworthiness analysis and credibility scoring. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of fake news and underlying challenges related to the process of estimating the veracity of a given claim, discussing challenges and proposing novel models to improve the current state of the art on different sub-tasks. Thus, besides the principal task (i.e., performing automated fact-checking) we also investigate the recognition of entities on noisy data and the computation of web site credibility. Ultimately, due to the challenging nature of the automated fact-checking task - which requires a complex analysis over several perspectives - we also contribute towards the reproducibility of scientific experiments. First, we tackle the named entity recognition problem. We propose a novel multi-level approach named HORUS which - given an input token - generates heuristics based on computer vision and text mining techniques. These heuristics are then used to detect and classify named entities on noisy data (e.g., The Web). Second, we propose WebCred, a novel model to compute the credibility score of a given website, regardless of dependency on search engine results, which is a limiting factor when dealing with real scenarios. WebCreddoes not require any third-party service and is 100% open-source. Third, we conduct several empirical evaluations and extend DeFacto, a fact-checking framework initially designed to verify English claims in RDF format. DeFacto supports both structured claims (e.g., triple-like) as well as complex claims (i.e., natural language sentences). Last, but not least, we consistently contributed towards better reproducibility research tools, methods, and methodologies. We proposed ontologies (MEX, ML-Schema) and tools (LOG4MEX, MEX-Interfaces, Web4MEX, WASOTA) which turned into state of the art for better reproducibility of machine learning experiments, becoming part of a global W3C community},

abstract = {Question answering (QA) over knowledge graphs has gained significant momentum over the past five years due to the increasing availability of large knowledge graphs and the rising importance of question answering for user interaction. DBpedia has been the most prominently used knowledge graph in this setting. QA systems implement a pipeline connecting a sequence of QA components for translating an input question into its corresponding formal query (e.g. SPARQL); this query will be executed over a knowledge graph in order to produce the answer of the question. Recent empirical studies have revealed that albeit overall effective, the performance of QA systems and QA components depends heavily on the features of input questions, and not even the combination of the best performing QA systems or individual QA components retrieves complete and correct answers. Furthermore, these QA systems cannot be easily reused, extended, and results cannot be easily reproduced since the systems are mostly implemented in a monolithic fashion, lack standardised interfaces, and are often not open source or available as Web services. All these drawbacks of the state of the art that prevents many of these approaches to be employed in real-world applications. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of QA over the knowledge graph and propose a generic approach to promote reusability and build question answering systems in a collaborative effort. Firstly, we define qa vocabulary and Qanary methodology to develop an abstraction level on existing QA systems and components. Qanary relies on qa vocabulary to establish guidelines for semantically describing the knowledge exchange between the components of a QA system. We implement a component-based modular framework called "Qanary Ecosystem" utilising the Qanary methodology to integrate several heterogeneous QA components in a single platform. We further present Qaestro framework that provides an approach to semantically describing question answering components and effectively enumerates QA pipelines based on a QA developer requirements. Qaestro provides all valid combinations of available QA components respecting the input-output requirement of each component to build QA pipelines. Finally, we address the scalability of QA components within a framework and propose a novel approach that chooses the best component per task to automatically build QA pipeline for each input question. We implement this model within FRANKENSTEIN, a framework able to select QA components and compose pipelines. FRANKENSTEIN extends Qanary ecosystem and utilises qa vocabulary for data exchange. It has 29 independent QA components implementing five QA tasks resulting in 360 unique QA pipelines. Each approach proposed in this thesis (Qanary methodology, Qaestro, and FRANKENSTEIN) is supported by extensive evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness. Our contributions target a broader research agenda of offering the QA community an efficient way of applying their research to a research field which is driven by many different fields, consequently requiring a collaborative approach to achieve significant progress in the domain of question answering.},

abstract = {The vast amount of data shared on the Web requires effective and efficient techniques to retrieve and create machine usable knowledge out of it. The creation of integrated knowledge from the Web, especially knowledge about the same entity spread over different web data sources, is a challenging task. Several data interoperability problems such as schema, structure, or domain conflicts need to be solved during the integration process. Semantic Web Technologies have evolved as a novel approach to tackle the problem of knowledge integration out of heterogeneous data. However, knowledge retrieval and integration from web data sources is an expensive process, mainly due to the Extraction-Transformation-Load approach that predominates the process. In addition, there are increasingly many scenarios, where a full physical integration of the data is either prohibitive (e.g. due to data being hidden behind APIs) or not allowed (e.g. for data privacy concerns). Thus, a more cost-effective and federated integration approach is needed, a method that supports organizations to create valuable insights out of the heterogeneous data spread on web sources. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of knowledge retrieval an integration from heterogeneous web sources and propose a holistic semantic knowledge retrieval and integration approach that creates knowledge graphs on-demand from a federation of web sources. We focus on the representation of web sources data, which belongs to the same entity, as pieces of knowledge to then synthesize them as knowledge graph solving interoperability conflicts at integration time. First, we propose MINTE, a novel semantic integration approach that solves interoperability conflicts present in heterogeneous web sources. MINTE defines the concept of RDF molecules to represent web sources data as pieces of knowledge. Then, MINTE relies on a semantic similarity function to determine RDF molecules belonging to the same entity. Finally, MINTE employs fusion policies for the synthesis of RDF molecules into a knowledge graph. Second, we define a similarity framework for RDF molecules to identify semantically equivalent entities. The framework includes state-of-the-art semantic similarity metrics, such as GADES, but also a semantic similarity metric based on embeddings named MateTee developed in the scope of this thesis. Ultimately, based on MINTE and our similarity framework, we design a federated semantic retrieval engine named FuhSen. FuhSen is able to effectively integrate data from heterogeneous web data sources and create an integrated knowledge graphs on-demand. FuhSen is equipped with a faceted browsing user interface oriented to facilitate the exploration of on-demand built knowledge graphs. We conducted several empirical evaluations to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our holistic approach. More importantly, three domain applications, i.e., Law Enforcement, Job Market Analysis, and Manufacturing, have been developed and managed by our approach. Both the empirical evaluations and concrete applications provide evidence that the methodology and techniques proposed in this thesis help to effectively integrate the pieces of knowledge about entities that are spread over heterogeneous web data sources.},

abstract = {Data, information and knowledge become key assets of our 21st century economy. As a result, data and knowledge management become key tasks with regard to sustainable development and business success. Often, knowledge is not explicitly represented residing in the minds of people or scattered among a variety of data sources. Knowledge is inherently associated with semantics that conveys its meaning to a human or machine agent. The Linked Data concept facilitates the semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources. However, we still lack an effective knowledge integration strategy applicable to enterprise scenarios, which balances between large amounts of data stored in legacy information systems and data lakes as well as tailored domain specific ontologies that formally describe real-world concepts. In this thesis we investigate strategies for managing linked enterprise data analyzing how actionable knowledge can be derived from enterprise data leveraging knowledge graphs. Actionable knowledge provides valuable insights, supports decision makers with clear interpretable arguments, and keeps its inference processes explainable. The benefits of employing actionable knowledge and its coherent management strategy span from a holistic semantic representation layer of enterprise data, i.e., representing numerous data sources as one, consistent, and integrated knowledge source, to unified interaction mechanisms with other systems that are able to effectively and efficiently leverage such an actionable knowledge. Several challenges have to be addressed on different conceptual levels pursuing this goal, i.e., means for representing knowledge, semantic data integration of raw data sources and subsequent knowledge extraction, communication interfaces, and implementation. In order to tackle those challenges we present the concept of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs), describe their characteristics and advantages compared to existing approaches. We study each challenge with regard to using EKGs and demonstrate their efficiency. In particular, EKGs are able to reduce the semantic data integration effort when processing large-scale heterogeneous datasets. Then, having built a consistent logical integration layer with heterogeneity behind the scenes, EKGs unify query processing and enable effective communication interfaces for other enterprise systems. The achieved results allow us to conclude that strategies for managing linked enterprise data based on EKGs exhibit reasonable performance, comply with enterprise requirements, and ensure integrated data and knowledge management throughout its life cycle.},

abstract = {Large amounts of geo-spatial information have been made available with the growth of the Web of Data. While discovering links between resources on the Web of Data has been shown to be a demanding task, discovering links between geo-spatial resources proves to be even more challenging. This is partly due to the resources being described by the means of vector geometry. Especially, discrepancies in granularity and error measurements across data sets render the selection of appropriate distance measures for geo-spatial resources difficult. In this paper, we survey existing literature for point-set measures that can be used to measure the similarity of vector geometries. We then present and evaluate the ten measures that we derived from literature. We evaluate these measures with respect to their time-efficiency and their robustness against discrepancies in measurement and in granularity. To this end, we use samples of real data sets of different granularity as input for our evaluation framework. The results obtained on three different data sets suggest that most distance approaches can be led to scale. Moreover, while some distance measures are significantly slower than other measures, distance measure based on means, surjections and sums of minimal distances are robust against the different types of discrepancies.},

abstract = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety. While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected. We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples). In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

Reasoning on these large amounts of geospatial data requires efficient methods for the computation of links between the resources contained in these knowledge bases. In this paper, we present RADON - efficient solution for the discovery of topological relations between geospatial resources according to the DE9-IM standard. Our evaluation shows that we outperform the state of the art significantly and by several orders of magnitude.},

However, to use and build applications on top of Linked Data is still a cumbersome and time-demanding task. We present KBox, an open-source platform that facilitates the distribution and consumption of RDF data. We show the different APIs implemented by KBox, as well as the processing steps from a SPARQL query to its corresponding result. Additionally, we demonstrate how KBox can be used to share RDF knowledge graphs and to instantiate SPARQL endpoints.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major research challenge today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most analytics approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e., can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simple feature-vector-based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, analytics methods which exploit expressive structures usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases. This software framework paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which supports expressive and scalable semantic analytics by providing functionality for distributed in-memory computing for RDF data. The library provides APIs for RDF storage, querying using SPARQL and forward chaining inference. It includes several machine learning algorithms for RDF knowledge graphs. The article describes the vision, architecture and use cases of SANSA.},

abstract = {Over the last years, the Linked Open Data (LOD) has evolved from a mere 12 to more than 10, 000 knowledge bases. These knowledge bases come from diverse domains including (but not limited to) publications, life sciences, social networking, government, media, linguistics. Moreover, the LOD cloud also contains a large number of crossdomain knowledge bases such as DBpedia and Yago2. These knowledge bases are commonly managed in a decentralized fashion and contain partly overlapping information. This architectural choice has led to knowledge pertaining to the same domain being published by independent entities in the LOD cloud. For example, information on drugs can be found in Diseasome as well as DBpedia and Drugbank. Furthermore, certain knowledge bases such as DBLP have been published by several bodies, which in turn has lead to duplicated content in the LOD. In addition, large amounts of geo-spatial information have been made available with the growth of heterogeneous Web of Data. The concurrent publication of knowledge bases containing related information promises to become a phenomenon of increasing importance with the growth of the number of independent data providers. Enabling the joint use of the knowledge bases published by these providers for tasks such as federated queries, cross-ontology question answering and data integration is most commonly tackled by creating links between the resources described within these knowledge bases. Within this thesis, we spur the transition from isolated knowledge bases to enriched Linked Data sets where information can be easily integrated and processed. To achieve this goal, we provide concepts, approaches and use cases that facilitate the integration and enrichment of information with other data types that are already present on the Linked Data Web with a focus on geo-spatial data. The first challenge that motivates our work is the lack of measures that use the geographic data for linking geo-spatial knowledge bases. This is partly due to the geo-spatial resources being described by the means of vector geometry. In particular, discrepancies in granularity and error measurements across knowledge bases render the selection of appropriate distance measures for geo-spatial resources difficult. We address this challenge by evaluating existing literature for pointset measures that can be used to measure the similarity of vector geometries. Then, we present and evaluate the ten measures that we derived from the literature on samples of three real knowledge bases. The second challenge we address in this thesis is the lack of automatic Link Discovery (LD) approaches capable of dealing with geospatial knowledge bases with missing and erroneous data. To this end,we present Colibri, an unsupervised approach that allows discovering links between knowledge bases while improving the quality of the instance data in these knowledge bases. A Colibri iteration begins by generating links between knowledge bases. Then, the approach makes use of these links to detect resources with probably erroneous or missing information. This erroneous or missing infor- mation detected by the approach is finally corrected or added. The third challenge we address is the lack of scalable LD approaches for tackling big geo-spatial knowledge bases. Thus, we present Deterministic Particle-Swarm Optimization (DPSO), a novel load balancing technique for LD on parallel hardware based on particle-swarm optimization. We combine this approach with the Orchid algorithm for geo-spatial linking and evaluate it on real and artificial data sets. The lack of approaches for automatic updating of links of an evolving knowledge base is our fourth challenge. This challenge is addressed in this thesis by the Wombat algorithm. Wombat is a novel approach for the discovery of links between knowledge bases that relies exclusively on positive examples. Wombat is based on generalisation via an upward refinement operator to traverse the space of Link Specifications (LS). We study the theoretical characteristics of Wombat and evaluate it on different benchmark data sets. The last challenge addressed herein is the lack of automatic approaches for geo-spatial knowledge base enrichment. Thus, we propose Deer, a supervised learning approach based on a refinement operator for enriching Resource Description Framework (RDF) data sets. We show how we can use exemplary descriptions of enriched resources to generate accurate enrichment pipelines. We evaluate our approach against manually defined enrichment pipelines and show that our approach can learn accurate pipelines even when provided with a small number of training examples. Each of the proposed approaches is implemented and evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches on real and/or artificial data sets. Moreover, all approaches are peer-reviewed and published in a con- ference or a journal paper. Throughout this thesis, we detail the ideas, implementation and the evaluation of each of the approaches. Moreover, we discuss each approach and present lessons learned. Finally, we conclude this thesis by presenting a set of possible future extensions and use cases for each of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {With the adoption of the Linked Data Paradigm in the enterprise context effective measures for securing sensitive data are in higher demand than ever before. Exemplary, integrating enterprise systems containing millions of assets and fine granular access control rules with large public background knowledge graphs leads to both a high number of triples and a high number of access control axioms, which traditional methods struggle to process. Therefore, we introduce novel approaches for enforcing access control on SPARQL queries and evaluate their implementation using an extension of the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark. Additionally, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the respective approaches and outline future work.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of NoSQL data base systems like MongoDB or CouchDB more and more applications store structured data according to a non-relational, document oriented model. Exposing this structured data as Linked Data is currently inhibited by a lack of standards as well as tools and requires the implementation of custom solutions. While recent efforts aim at expressing transformations of such data models into RDF in a standardized manner, there is a lack of approaches which facilitate SPARQL execution over mapped non-relational data sources. With SparqlMap-M we show how dynamic SPARQL access to non-relational data can be achieved. SparqlMap-M is an extension to our SPARQL-to-SQL rewriter SparqlMap that performs a (partial) transformation of SPARQL queries by using a relational abstraction over a document store. Further, duplicate data in the document store is used to reduce the number of joins and custom optimizations are introduced. Our showcase scenario employs the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM) with different adaptions to a document data model. We use this scenario to demonstrate the viability of our approach and compare it to different MongoDB setups and native SQL.},

This approach is inspired by Continuous Integration pipelines, that have been introduced in the area of software development and DevOps to perform continuous source code checks. By investigating in possible tools to use and discussing the specific requirements for RDF data sets, an integration pipeline is derived that joins current approaches of the areas of software-development and semantic-web as well as reuses existing tools. As these tools have not been built explicitly for CI usage, we evaluate their usability and propose possible workarounds and improvements. Furthermore, a real-world usage scenario is discussed, outlining the benefit of the usage of such a pipeline.},

abstract = {Openly available datasets originate from different data providers which range from government agencies, over commercial enterprises to communities of data enthusiasts. Integrating different source datasets into a single RDF graph by using ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) sys- tems which perform offline transformation, ontology matching and link- ing techniques usually takes many iterations of revisions until the target dataset is made free of the most obvious mapping, linking and consis- tency errors. Since ETL systems produce the RDF offline, any map- ping or content change requires a re-ingest of the relevant source data. When dealing with heterogeneous source datasets, creating a unified tar- get dataset can be a tedious undertaking. Therefore the paper proposes an RDF view based ingestion approach, which allows real-time debugging of the unified dataset where mappings and links can be changed with immediate effect. Once the unified graph passes all data quality tests, the RDF can be materialized. This process poses an alternative to existing ETL solutions.},

Modern data-driven applications often have to integrate large amounts of data relaying on fast but accurate Link Discovery solutions. Hence, they often operate under time or space constraints. Additionally, most Link Discovery frameworks rely on complex link specifications to determine candidates for links, in which the scalability of execution is of significant importance. The main focus of our work is the implementation of time efficient and scalable data linking approaches by the utilizing Semantic Web technologies. In this work, we address these Link Discovery challenges by presenting a novel approach for time constraint linking, efficient computation and scalable execution of link specifications with applications towards periodically updated KBs.},

abstract = {Managing the lifecycle of RDF datasets is a cumbersome activity. Substantial efforts are spent on reproducing datasets over time. But, these efforts can be reduced by a data management workflow framework. We present the Linked Data Workflow Project ontology as the knowledge model for such a workflow framework. The ontology is centered on the Plan, Method, and Execution classes, facilitating the description of: i) the methodological process that guides the lifecycle of RDF datasets, ii) the complete plan of the RDF dataset production workflow, and iii) the executions of workflow. As a result, our approach enables the reproducibility and repeatability of Linked Data processing steps over time.},

abstract = {The Web encompasses a significant amount of knowledge hidden in entity-attributes tables. Bridging the gap between these tables and the Web of Data thus has the potential to facilitate a large number of applications, including the augmentation of knowledge bases from tables, the search for related tables and the completion of tables using knowledge bases. Computing such bridges is impeded by the poor accuracy of automatic property mapping, the lack of approaches for the discovery of subject columns and the mere size of table corpora. In addition, tables on the Web most commonly do not contain any RDFa or other form of semantic annotation. We propose TAIPAN, a novel approach for recovering the semantics of tables. Our approach begins by identifying subject columns using a combination of structural and semantic features. It then maps binary relations inside a table to predicates from a given knowledge base. Therewith, our solution supports both the tasks of table expansion and knowledge base augmentation. We evaluate our approach on a table dataset generated from real RDF data and a manually curated version of the T2D gold standard. Our results suggest that we outperform the state of the art by up to 85% F-measure.},

It can be beneficial in various data and schema analysis tasks with applications in different standard machine learning scenarios, e.g. in the life sciences, as well as Semantic Web specific applications such as ontology learning and enrichment. Since its creation in 2007, it has become the main OWL and RDF-based software framework for supervised structured machine learning and includes several algorithm implementations, usage examples and has applications building on top of the framework. The article gives an overview of the framework with a focus on algorithms and use cases.},

abstract = {Sharing information securely between business partners and managing large supply chains efficiently will be a crucial competitive advantage for enterprises in the near future. In this paper, we present a concept that allows for building value networks between business partners in a distributed manner. Companies are able to publish Linked Data which participants of the network can clone and subscribe to. Subscribers get notified as soon as new information becomes available. This provides a technical infrastructure for business communication acts such as supply chain communication or master data management. In addition to the conceptual analysis, we provide an implementation enabling companies to create such dynamic semantic value networks.},

The objective of Heloise is to interlink databases and other digital resources stemming from several research projects in the field of academic history, to provide an integrated database for federated research on the network databases. The HCRM defines three layers: the Repository Layer, the Application Layer and the Research Interface Layer, which are presented in detail. As part of the application and research interface layer, essential concepts are the symogih.org ontology and a Heloise network-specific thesaurus. The concepts have been tested on a sample of Heloise network????????s datasets as a part of a prototype of the envisaged platform that the authors have started implementing. The paper concludes with future developments to be accomplished within the Heloise network.Keywords: academic history, domain ontologies, data interoperability, semantic web technologies, linked open data.Investigaci????n colaborativa sobre la historia acad????mica a trav????s de los datos abiertos enlazados: una propuesta para el modelo de investigaci????n com????n de H????lo????se Resumen: El art????culo presenta una propuesta para el modelo de investigaci????n com????n de H????lo????se (HCRM en sus siglas en ingl????s) para su implementaci????n por la red de investigaci????n europea sobre la historia acad????mica digital ???????? H????lo????se. El objetivo de H????lo????se es interconectar las bases de datos y otros recursos digitales que pertenecen a varios proyectos de investigaci????n en el campo de la historia acad????mica con el fin de ofrecer una base de datos integrada para la investigaci????n federada sobre las bases de datos de la Red. El HCRM define tres niveles: el nivel del repositorio, el nivel de la aplicaci????n y el nivel de la interfaz de la investigaci????n que se explican de forma detallada. Como parte del nivel de la interfaz de la investigaci????n, la ontolog????a symogih.org y un diccionario de sin????nimos para la red H????lo????se constituyen conceptos fundamentales. Los conceptos han sido probados sobre una muestra de datos de la red H????lo????se como parte de un prototipo de la plataforma que los autores han empezado a desarrollar. El art????culo concluye con propuestas de futuro desarrollo a realizar dentro del marco de la red H????lo????se.

abstract = {Despite recent efforts to achieve a high level of interoperability of Machine Learning (ML) experiments, positively collaborating with the Reproducible Research context, we still run into the problems created due to the existence of different ML platforms: each of those have a specific conceptualization or schema for representing data and metadata. This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.},

abstract = {Coherent and consistent tracking of provenance data and in particular update history information is a crucial building block for any serious information system architecture. Version Control Systems can be a part of such an architecture enabling users to query and manipulate versioning information as well as content revisions. In this paper, we introduce an RDF versioning approach as a foundation for a full featured RDF Version Control System. We argue that such a system needs support for all concepts of the RDF specification including support for RDF datasets and blank nodes. Furthermore, we placed special emphasis on the protection against unperceived history manipulation by hashing the resulting patches. In addition to the conceptual analysis and an RDF vocabulary for representing versioning information, we present a mature implementation which captures versioning information for changes to arbitrary RDF datasets.},

abstract = {The development of standard models for describing general lexical resources has led to the emergence of numerous lexical datasets of various languages in the Semantic Web. However, there are no models that describe the domain of morphology in a similar manner. As a result, there are hardly any language resources of morphemic data available in RDF to date. This paper presents the creation of the Hebrew Morpheme Inventory from a manually compiled tabular dataset comprising around 52.000 entries. It is an ongoing effort of representing the lexemes, word-forms and morphologigal patterns together with their underlying relations based on the newly created Multilingual Morpheme Ontology (MMoOn). It will be shown how segmented Hebrew language data can be granularly described in a Linked Data format, thus, serving as an exemplary case for creating morpheme inventories of any inflectional language with MMoOn. The resulting dataset is described a) according to the structure of the underlying data format, b) with respect to the Hebrew language characteristic of building word-forms directly from roots, c) by exemplifying how inflectional information is realized and d) with regard to its enrichment with external links to sense resources.},

abstract = {Over the past years, the size of the Data Web has increased significantly, which makes obtaining general insights into its growth and structure both more challenging and more desirable. The lack of such insights hinders important data management tasks such as quality, privacy and coverage analysis. In this paper, we present LODStats, which provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of a significant part of the Data Web. LODStats integrates RDF datasets from data.gov, publicdata.eu and datahub.io data catalogs and at the time of writing lists over 9 000 RDF datasets. For each RDF dataset, LODStats collects comprehensive statistics and makes these available in adhering to the LDSO vocabulary. This analysis has been regularly published and enhanced over the past four years at the public platform lodstats.aksw.org. We give a comprehensive overview over the resulting dataset.},

abstract = {Supply Chain Management aims at optimizing the flow of goods and services from the producer to the consumer. Closely interconnected enterprises that align their production, logistics and procurement with one another thus enjoy a competitive advantage in the market. To achieve a close alignment, an instant, robust and efficient information flow along the supply chain between and within enterprises is required. However, less efficient human communication is often used instead of automatic systems because of the great diversity of enterprise systems and models. This paper describes an approach and its implementation SCM Intelligence App, which enables the configuration of individual supply chains together with the execution of industry accepted performance metrics. Based on machine-processable supply chain data model (the SCORVoc RDF vocabulary implementing the SCOR standard) and W3C standardized protocols such as SPARQL, the approach represents an alternative to closed software systems, which lack support for inter-organizational supply chain analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach using a prototypical implementation and a test scenario.},

abstract = {In the context of the European Digital Agenda governmental authorities as well as virtual communities (e.g. datahub.io) have published a large amount of open datasets. This is a fundamentally positive development, however one can observe that many different that both for the metadata and the data itself different vocabularies are in use. Furthermore, the established vocabularies are often augmented with portal specific metadata standards and published in different (local) languages. If Open Data are to be integrated and aggregated across portals, this entails a lot of effort. In this paper we present examples how the problems of interoperability and multilingualism could be addressed for key open data asset descriptors. We focus on the analysis of today's problems and ways to solve them.},

abstract = {The DBpedia dataset has multiple URIs within the dataset and from other datasets connected with (transitive) owl:sameAs relations and thus referring to the same concepts. With this heterogeneity of identifiers it is complicated for users and agents to find the unique identifier which should be preferably used. We are introducing the concept of DBpedia Unique Identifier (DUI) and a dataset of linksets relating URIs to DUIs. In order to improve the quality of our dataset we developed a mechanism that allows the user to rate and suggest links. As proof of concept an implementation with a graphical web user interface is provided for accessing the linkset and rating the links. The DBpedia sameAs service is available at http://dbpsa.aksw.org/SameAsService.},

abstract = {The extraction and maintenance of Linked Data datasets is a cumbersome, time-consuming and resource-intensive activity. The cost for producing Linked Data can be reduced by a workflow management system, which describes plans to systematically support the lifecycle of RDF datasets. We present the LODFlow Linked Data Workflow Management System, which provides an environment for planning, executing, reusing, and documenting Linked Data workflows. The LODFlow approach is based on a comprehensive knowledge model for describing the workflows and a workflow execution engine supporting systematic workflow execution, reporting, and exception handling. The environment was evaluated in a large-scale real-world use case. As result, LODFlow supports Linked Data engineers to systematically plan, execute and assess Linked Data production and maintenance workflows, thus improving efficiency, ease-of-use, reproducibility, reuseability and provenance.},

abstract = {The volume of unstructured information presented on the Internet is constantly increasing, together with the total amount of websites and their contents. To process this vast amount of information it is important to distinguish different clusters of related webpages. Such clusters are used, for example, for knowledge extraction, named entity recognition, and recommendation algorithms. A variety of applications (such as semantic analysis systems, crawlers and search engines) utilizes semantic clustering algorithms to recognize thematically connected webpages. The majority of them relies on text analysis of the web documents content, and this leads to certain limitations, such as long processing time, need of representative text content, or vagueness of natural language. In this article, we present an framework for unsupervised domain and language independent semantic clustering of the website, which utilizes its internal hypertext structure and does not require text analysis. As a basis, we represent the hypertext structure as a graph and apply known flow simulation clustering algorithms to the graph to produce a set of webpage clusters. We assume these clusters contain thematically connected webpages. We evaluate our clustering approach with a corpus of real-world webpages and compare the approach with well-known text document clustering algorithms.},

Based on the selected structural part, CubeViz offers suitable chart types and options for configuring the visualization by users. In this demo we present the CubeViz visualization architecture and components, sketch its underlying API and the libraries used to generate the desired output. By employing advanced introspection, analysis and visualization bootstrapping techniques CubeViz hides the schema complexity of the encoded data in order to support a user-friendly exploration experience.},

abstract = {The combination of the advantages of widely used relational databases and semantic technologies has attracted significant research over the past decade. In particular, mapping languages for the conversion of databases to RDF knowledge bases have been developed and standardized in the form of R2RML. In this article, we first review those mapping languages and then devise work towards a unified formal model for them. Based on this, we present the Sparqlification Mapping Language (SML), which provides an intuitive way to declare mappings based on SQL VIEWS and SPARQL construct queries. We show that SML has the same expressivity as R2RML by enumerating the language features and show the correspondences, and we outline how one syntax can be converted into the other. A conducted user study for this paper juxtaposing SML and R2RML provides evidence that SML is a more compact syntax which is easier to understand and read and thus lowers the barrier to offer SPARQL access to relational databases.},

abstract = {With the adoption of RDF across several domains, come growing requirements pertaining to the completeness and quality of RDF datasets. Currently, this problem is most commonly addressed by manually devising means of enriching an input dataset. The few tools that aim at supporting this endeavour usually focus on supporting the manual definition of enrichment pipelines. In this paper, we present a supervised learning approach based on a refinement operator for enriching RDF datasets. We show how we can use exemplary descriptions of enriched resources to generate accurate enrichment pipelines. We evaluate our approach against eight manually defined enrichment pipelines and show that our approach can learn accurate pipelines even when provided with a small number of training examples.},

abstract = {The curation of a knowledge base is a key task for ensuring the correctness and traceability of the knowledge provided in the said knowledge. This task is often carried out manually by human curators, who attempt to provide reliable facts and their respective sources in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keywordsqueries for the fact to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. However, this process is very time-consuming, mainly due to the human curators having to scrutinize the web pages retrieved by search engines. This demo paper demonstrate the RESTful implementation for DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) ???????? an approach able to validate facts in RDF by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to support the validation of facts by supplying the user with (1) relevant excerpts of web pages as well as (2) useful additional information including (3) a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. We also provide an extension for finding similar resources obtained from the Linked Data, using the sameas.org service as backend. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate the time frame within which a fact was valid.},

On the other hand, the Web of Science consists of high quality information created and reviewed by the international community of researchers. While it is a complicated process to switch from traditional publishing methods to methods, which enable data publishing in machine-readable formats, the situation can be improved by at least exposing metadata about the scientific publications in machine-readable format. In this paper we aim at metadata, hidden inside universities' internal databases, reports and other hard to discover sources. We extend the VIVO ontology and create the VIVO+ ontology. We define and describe a framework for automatic conversion of university data to RDF. We showcase the VIVO+ ontology and the framework using the example of the ITMO university.},

abstract = {Over the last decades many machine learning experiments have been published, giving benefit to the scientific progress. In order to compare machine-learning experiment results with each other and collaborate positively, they need to be performed thoroughly on the same computing environment, using the same sample datasets and algorithm configurations. Besides this, practical experience shows that scientists and engineers tend to have large output data in their experiments, which is both difficult to analyze and archive properly without provenance metadata. However, the Linked Data community still misses a light-weight specification for interchanging machine-learning metadata over different architectures to achieve a higher level of interoperability. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel vocabulary dubbed MEX. We show that MEX provides a prompt method to describe experiments with a special focus on data provenance and fulfills the requirements for a long-term maintenance.},

abstract = {Online social networking has become one of the most popular services on the Web. Especially Facebook with its 845Mio+ monthly active users and 100Mrd+ friendship relations creates a Web inside the Web. Drawing on the metaphor of islands, Facebook is becoming more like a continent. However, users are locked up on this continent with hardly any opportunity to communicate easily with users on other islands and continents or even to relocate trans-continentally. In addition to that, privacy, data ownership and freedom of communication issues are problematically in centralized environments. The idea of distributed social networking enables users to overcome the drawbacks of centralized social networks. The goal of this thesis is to provide an architecture for distributed social networking based on semantic technologies. This architecture consists of semantic artifacts, protocols and services which enable social network applications to work in a distributed environment and with semantic interoperability. Furthermore, this thesis presents applications for distributed semantic social networking and discusses user interfaces, architecture and communication strategies for this application category.},

The existing managing infrastructure is not yet suitable for the upcoming requirements and does not provide support for flexible and extensible data models for being future-proof. In this paper we present a system that uses the generic RDF resource management system OntoWiki for managing library resources. OntoWiki is extended by components for adapting the generic system to the given domain, e.g. by using data templates. In addition the Linked Data capability of OntoWiki is used and extended to import various metadata to enrich the managing resource. Consequently using Linked Data further enables libraries to build up a Linked Data infrastructure in the library domain.},

abstract = {The main criteria for the successful use of Semantic Web technologies are a user-friendly and intuitive design of user interfaces (especially for web applications) and an acceptable performance with regard to the production, processing and publication of semantically represented data. Data management schemata used in the Semantic Web (Triple Stores) generally offer a high degree of flexibility for the management of information by means of RDF graphs, taxonomies, vocabularies or ontologies. However, this aspect is accompanied by challenges concerning the usability and performance in the development of Semantic Web applications, especially when complex information structures and corresponding queries have to be processed. Therefore, if priority is given to easing the use and performance of the software, development risks have to be taken into account. To minimize these risks, this thesis proposes a categorization model which can be used to assist in the specification of requirements. Furthermore, approaches are presented that foster the reduction and optimization of SPARQL queries on the application side, and thus positively influence the process of run-time optimization of Semantic Web applications. Dedicated strategies are developed for the exploration and visualization of specific data modalities, such as spatial, statistical, and multilingual data. Based on these concepts, software components are developed, optimized and integrated into existing web applications. The approaches elaborated in this work are evaluated by using the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark as well as Web applications from different domains such as tourism, finance and statistics.},

abstract = {The prime aspect of quality for search-driven web applications is to provide users with the best possible results for a given query. Thus, it is necessary to predict the relevance of results a priori. Current solutions mostly engage clicks on results for respective predictions, but research has shown that it is highly beneficial to also consider additional features of user interaction. Nowadays, such interactions are produced in steadily growing amounts by internet users. Processing these amounts calls for streaming-based approaches and incrementally updateable relevance models. We present StreamMyRelevance!--a novel streaming-based system for ensuring quality of ranking in search engines. Our approach provides a complete pipeline from collecting interactions in real-time to processing them incrementally on the server side. We conducted a large-scale evaluation with real-world data from the hotel search domain. Results show that our system yields predictions as good as those of competing state-of-the-art systems, but by design of the underlying framework at higher efficiency, robustness, and scalability.},

abstract = {The Financial Transparency System (FTS) of the European Commission contains information about grants for European Union projects starting from 2007. It allows users to get an overview on EU funding, including information on beneficiaries as well as the amount and type of expenditure and information on the responsible EU department. The original dataset is freely available on the European Commission website, where users can query the data using an HTML form and download it in CSV and most recently XML format. In this article, we describe the transformation of this data to RDF and its interlinking with other datasets. We show that this allows interesting queries over the data, which were very difficult without this conversion. The main benefit of the dataset is an increased financial transparency of EU project funding. The RDF version of the FTS dataset will become part of the EU Open Data Portal and eventually be hosted and maintained by the European Union itself.},

In the Caucasus Ecoregion such information is virtually non-existent for invertebrate taxa. Using occurrence data from a large database we calculated species distribution models with the GARP algorithm for 471 spider species to visualize the diversity distribution of spider species in this region. Overall species diversity was highest in mountain forests of the North Caucasus, east-central Georgia, the southern slopes of the eastern Great Caucasus and south-east Azerbaijan. A regression tree analysis Chi squared automatic interaction detector method revealed the mean temperature of the driest quarter and precipitation parameters to be the main environmental factors shaping these patterns. Diversity of endemic species was correlated with overall species diversity but hotspots of endemic species (10+ percent of all species) exists in high-mountain areas, suggesting post-glacial speciation events in the high mountains as the main sources of high endemism in Caucasus. Further information on the spatial distribution of species diversity of invertebrate taxa in the Caucasus Ecoregion is needed to improve conservation efforts in this biodiversity hotspot.},

The dataset was created by integrating data from two different semi-structured sources and aligned to an ontology designed to represent multilingual data from sources with a hierarchical structure. The resulting RDF data encompasses 43 different languages which belong to the most under-represented languages in the Linked Data Cloud, including Arabic, Amharic and Amazigh. We designed the dataset to be easily usable in natural-language processing applications with the goal of facilitating the development of knowledge extraction tools for these languages. In particular, the Semantic Quran is compatible with the Natural-Language Interchange Format and contains explicit morpho-syntactic information on the utilized terms. We present the ontology devised for structuring the data. We also provide the transformation rules implemented in our extraction framework. Finally, we detail the link creation process as well as possible usage scenarios for the Semantic Quran dataset.},

In this paper we propose a concept that allows content authors to use the power of the crowd to create (semantically) structured multilingual educational content out of their material. To enable the collaboration of the crowd, we expand our previously developed CrowdLearn concept and WikiApp data model to support multilingual educational content. The expanded concept, CoSMEC, was evaluated with an example implementation within the web-based educational platform SlideWiki. Based on this experience, we provide solutions for the most complicated technical issues we faced during the implementation. This paper also discusses statistics which show the flow of multilingual content usage.},

The more the amount of published information grows, the more important are technologies for accessing, analysing, summarising and visualising information. While substantial progress has been made in the last years in each of these areas individually, we argue, that only the intelligent combination of approaches will make this progress truly useful and leverage further synergies between techniques. In this paper we develop a text analytics architecture of participation, which allows ordinary people to use sophisticated NLP techniques for analysing and visualizing their content, be it a Blog, Twitter feed, Website or article collection. The architecture comprises interfaces for information access, natural language processing and visualization. Different exchangeable components can be plugged into this architecture, making it easy to tailor for individual needs. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by comparing both the effectiveness and efficiency of end users within a task-solving setting. Moreover, we evaluate the usability of our approach using a questionnaire-driven approach. Both evaluations suggest that ordinary Web users are empowered to analyse their data and perform tasks, which were previously out of reach.},

abstract = {The core of a Linked Data application is the processing of the knowledge expressed as Linked Data. Therefore the creation, management, curation and publication of Linked Data are critical aspects for an application's success. For all of these aspects the LOD2 project provides components. These components have been collected and placed under one distribution umbrella: the LOD2 stack. In this chapter we will introduce this component stack. We will show how to get access; which component covers which aspect of the Linked Data life cycle and how using the stack eases the access to Linked Data management tools. Furthermore we will elaborate how the stack can be used to support a knowledge domain. The illustrated domain is statistical data.},

abstract = {Recently, a large number of dataset repositories, catalogs and portals are emerging in the science and government realms. Once a large number of datasets are published on such data portals, the question arises how to retrieve datasets satisfying a user's information need. In this article, we present an approach for retrieving datasets according to user queries. We define dataset retrieval as a specialization of information retrieval. Instead of retrieving documents that are relevant to a certain information need, dataset retrieval describes the process of returning relevant RDF datasets. As with information retrieval, the term relevance cannot be clearly defined when using traditional methods like stemming. The inherent usage of RDF in RDF datasets enables a better way of retrieving relevant ones. We therefore propose an additional retrieval mechanism, which is inspired by facet search: dataset filtering. When querying, the entire set of available datasets is processed by a set of semantic filters each of which can unambiguously decide whether or not a given dataset is relevant to the query. The resulting set is then given back to the requester. We implemented and evaluated our approach in CKAN, which fuels publicdata.eu and is the most popular data portal worldwide.},

abstract = {While there is meanwhile a plethora of Learning Content Management Systems, the collaborative, community- based creation of rich e-learning content is still not sufficiently well supported. There have been some efforts to apply the Ward Cunningham's wiki paradigm to the creation of e-learning content. However, the paradigm was mainly only applied to unstructured, textual content and can not be used in SCORM-compliant systems. To address the issue we develop the CrowdLearn concept to exploit the wisdom, creativity and productivity of the crowd for the creation of rich, deep-semantically structured e-learning content. The CrowdLearn con- cept combines the wiki style for collaborative content authoring with SCORM requirements for re-usability. Therefore, it enables splitting the learning material into Learning Objects (LOs) with an adjustable level of granularity. In order to realize the CrowdLearn concept, a novel data model called WikiApp is devised. The WikiApp data model is a refinement of the traditional entity-relationship data model with further emphasis on collaborative social activities and structured content authoring. We implement and evaluate the CrowdLearn approach with SlideWiki---an educational platform dealing with presentations and questionnaires. The article also comprises results of a usability evaluation with real students.},

abstract = {Advantages and disadvantages of a learning assessment based on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are a long and widely discussed issue in the scientific community. However, in practice this type of questions is very popular due to the possibility of automatic evaluation and scoring. Consequently, an important research question is to exploiting the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of MCQs. In this work we discuss one particularly important issue of MCQs, namely methods for scoring results in the case, when the MCQ has several correct alternatives (multiple-mark questions, MMQs). We propose a general approach and mathematical model to score MMQs, that aims at recognizing guessing while at the same time resulting in a balanced score. In our approach conventional MCQs are viewed as a particular case of multiple-mark questions, thus, the formulas can be applied to tests mixing MCQs and MMQs. The rational of our approach is that scoring should be based on the guessing level of the question. Our approach can be added as an option, or even as a replacement for manual penalization. We show that our scoring method outperforms existing methods and demonstrate that with synthetic and real experiments.},

abstract = {Cognition is determined by function and interplay of several hundred if not thousand genes with a considerable overlap in the phenotypes and genes causing different cognitive diseases. We argue that these diseases should not be studied in isolation, but that data allowing to study them should be integrated. Ultimately, this will allow researchers to more easily answer questions, which would otherwise require time-consuming research. Specifically, we propose to use Linked Data publication, data integration and querying methods, which has been successfully used in other life science domains. In this initial effort, we converted 12 different datasets, integrate them and provide a first demonstration of the added value by showing how a set of relevant queries over the integrated data can be answered.},

Query expansion methods augment the original query of a user with alternative query elements with similar meaning to increase the chance of retrieving appropriate resources. In this work, we introduce a number of new query expansion features based on semantic and linguistic inferencing over Linked Open Data. We evaluate the effectiveness of each feature individually as well as their combinations employing several machine learning approaches. The evaluation is carried out on a training dataset extracted from the QALD Question Answering benchmark. Furthermore, we propose an optimized linear combination of linguistic and lightweight semantic features in order to predict the usefulness of each expansion candidate. Our experimental study shows a considerable improvement in precision and recall over baseline approaches.},

We analyzed the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources and classified them according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to a specific crowdsourcing approach. Based on this analysis, we implemented and compared two quality assessment methods for Linked Data that leverage the wisdom of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest format targeting an expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluated the two methods empirically in terms of their capacity to spot quality issues in DBpedia and investigated how the contributions of the two crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation processes. The results showed that the two styles of crowdsourcing are complementary, and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data sets.},

Despite recent advances, consuming and using Linked Open Data within an organization is still a substantial challenge. Many of the LOD datasets are quite large and despite progress in RDF data management their loading and querying within a triple store is extremely time-consuming and resource-demanding. To overcome this consumption obstacle, we propose a process inspired by the classical Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) paradigm. In this article, we focus particularly on the selection and extraction steps of this process. We devise a fragment of SPARQL dubbed SliceSPARQL, which enables the selection of well-defined slices of datasets fulfilling typical information needs. SliceSPARQL supports graph patterns for which each connected subgraph pattern involves a maximum of one variable or IRI in its join conditions. This restriction guarantees the efficient processing of the query against a sequential dataset dump stream. As a result our evaluation shows that dataset slices can be generated an order of magnitude faster than by using the conventional approach of loading the whole dataset into a triple store and retrieving the slice by executing the query against the triple store's SPARQL endpoint.},

abstract = {Governments and public administrations started recently to publish large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of tabular data such as CSV files or Excel sheets. Various tools and projects have been launched aiming at facilitating the lifting of tabular data to reach semantically structured and linked data. However, none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go data publication and mapping strategy, which enables effort sharing between data owners, community experts and consumers. In this article, we present an approach for enabling the user-driven semantic mapping of large amounts tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users, but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular mappings use cases. We outline a formal approach for mapping tabular data to RDF. Default mappings are automatically created and can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion. We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost 10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.},

abstract = {We are currently observing a plethora of Natural Language Processing tools and services being made available. Each of the tools and services has its particular strengths and weaknesses, but exploiting the strengths and synergistically combining different tools is currently an extremely cumbersome and time consuming task. Also, once a particular set of tools is integrated, this integration is not reusable by others. We argue that simplifying the interoperability of different NLP tools performing similar but also complementary tasks will facilitate the comparability of results and the creation of sophisticated NLP applications. In this paper, we present the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). NIF is based on a Linked Data enabled URI scheme for identifying elements in (hyper-)texts and an ontology for describing common NLP terms and concepts. In contrast to more centralized solutions such as UIMA and GATE, NIF enables the creation of heterogeneous, distributed and loosely coupled NLP applications, which use the Web as an integration platform. We present several use cases of the second version of the NIF specification (NIF 2.0) and the result of a developer study.},

abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured datasets on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and even extracted data of relatively low quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, which comprises of a manual and a semi-automatic process. The first phase includes the detection of common quality problems and their representation in a quality problem taxonomy. In the manual process, the second phase comprises of the evaluation of a large number of individual resources, according to the quality problem taxonomy via crowdsourcing. This process is accompanied by a tool wherein a user assesses an individual resource and evaluates each fact for correctness. The semi-automatic process involves the generation and verification of schema axioms. We report the results obtained by applying this methodology to DBpedia. We identified 17 data quality problem types and 58 users assessed a total of 521 resources. Overall, 11.93% of the evaluated DBpedia triples were identified to have some quality issues. Applying the semi-automatic component yielded a total of 222,982 triples that have a high probability to be incorrect. In particular, we found that problems such as object values being incorrectly extracted, irrelevant extraction of information and broken links were the most recurring quality problems. With this study, we not only aim to assess the quality of this sample of DBpedia resources but also adopt an agile methodology to improve the quality in future versions by regularly providing feedback to the DBpedia maintainers.},

In the last decade, the prevalent data integration approaches were primarily based on XML, Web Services and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). We argue that classic SOA architectures may be well-suited for transaction processing, however more efficient technologies can be employed for enterprise data integration. In particular, the use of the Linked Data paradigm appears to be a very promising approach. In this article we explore challenges large enterprises are still facing with regard to data integration. We discuss Linked Data approaches in these areas and present some examples of successful applications of the Linked Data principles in that context.},

abstract = {Purpose - DBpedia extracts structured information from Wikipedia, interlinks it with other knowledge bases and freely publishes the results on the Web using Linked Data and SPARQL. However, the DBpedia release process is heavy-weight and releases are sometimes based on several months old data. DBpedia-Live solves this problem by providing a live synchronization method based on the update stream of Wikipedia. Design/methodology/approach - Wikipedia provides DBpedia with a continuous stream of updates, i.e. a stream of recently updated articles. DBpedia-Live processes that stream on the fly to obtain RDF data and stores the extracted data back to DBpedia. DBpedia-Live publishes the newly added/deleted triples in files, in order to enable synchronization between our DBpedia endpoint and other DBpedia mirrors. Findings - During the realization of DBpedia-Live we learned, that it is crucial to process Wikipedia updates in a priority queue. Recently-updated Wikipedia articles should have the highest priority, over mapping-changes and unmodified pages. An overall finding is that there is a plenty of opportunities arising from the emerging Web of Data for librarians. Practical implications - DBpedia had and has a great effect on the Web of Data and became a crystallization point for it. Many companies and researchers use DBpedia and its public services to improve their applications and research approaches. The DBpedia-Live framework improves DBpedia further by timely synchronizing it with Wikipedia, which is relevant for many use cases requiring up-to-date information. Originality/value - The new DBpedia-Live framework adds new features to the old DBpedia-Live framework, e.g. abstract extraction, ontology changes, and changesets publication.},

abstract = {Recently practical approaches for managing and supporting the life-cycle of semantic content on the Web of Data made quite some progress. However, the currently least developed aspect of the semantic content life-cycle is the user-friendly manual and semi-automatic creation of rich semantic content. In this paper we present the RDFaCE approach for combining WYSIWYG text authoring with the creation of rich semantic annotations. Our approach is based on providing four different views to the content authors: a classical WYSIWYG view, a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) view making the semantic annotations visible, a fact view and the respective HTML/RDFa source code view. The views are synchronized such that changes made in one of the views automatically update the others. They provide different means of semantic content authoring for the different personas involved in the content creation life-cycle. For bootstrapping the semantic annotation process we integrate five different text annotation services. We evaluate their accuracy and empirically show that a combination of them yields superior results.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a query abstraction mechanism which allows web/mobile-service administrator to formulate a skeleton of a sequence of SQL queries by parameterizing holes, later being filled by end-users. The mechanism is generic as the administrator can use it to register multiple services, and expandable as the existing service can be specialized, to automatically generate new kinds of personalized services. An end-user's input, when given in its entirety, initiates the automatic generation of appropriate SQL queries suitable for the user's requested service. A personalized service can be devised by designating the enduser's input parameters into static or dynamic. When static input arguments are given, a specialized skeleton service with respect to the given input is created. The mechanism is implemented to be used in systems for web/mobile-based information and transaction services.},

abstract = {A special activity, that became possible nowadays, is the collaborative e-learning and collaborative engineering of learning materials. Such an opportunity is available in educational systems, based on the wiki paradigm. However, Ward Cunningham's wiki paradigm was mainly only applied to unstructured, textual content thus limiting the content structuring, re-purposing and reuse. Some steps in this direction are made by Semantic Web technologies and their combination with the wiki paradigm. In many potential usage scenarios, however, the(semi-)structured educational content (e.g. presentations, questionnaires, diagrams, etc.) should be managed and the collaboration of large user communities around such content should be effectively facilitated. We present the CrowdLearn concept for collaborative engineering of the semantically structured learning objects as well as a model-driven approach to generate the wiki-like application operating in the spirit of CrowdLearn. We implement and evaluate the approach with Slidewiki - an educational platform mainly dealing with slide presentations. The article also comprises a usability evaluation with real students.},

abstract = {Evidence-based policy is policy informed by rigorously established objective evidence. An important aspect of evidence-based policy is the use of scientifically rigorous studies to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Statistics represent a crucial means to determine whether progress is made towards policy targets. In May 2010, the European Commission adopted the Digital Agenda for Europe, a strategy to take advantage of the potential offered by the rapid progress of digital technologies. The Digital Agenda contains commitments to undertake a number of specific policy actions intended to stimulate a circle of investment in and usage of digital technologies. It identifies 13 key performance targets. In order to chart the progress of both the announced policy actions and the key performance targets a scoreboard is published, thus allowing the monitoring and benchmarking of the main developments of information society in European countries. In addition to these human-readable browsing, visualization and exploration methods, machine-readable access facilitating re-usage and interlinking of the underlying data is provided by means of RDF and Linked Open Data. We sketch the transformation process from raw data up to rich, interlinked RDF, describe its publishing and the lessons learned.},

abstract = {Up to the present day much effort has been made to publish government data on the Web. However, such data has been published in different formats. For any particular source and use (e.g. exploration, visualization, integration) of such information special applications have to be written. This limits the overall usability of the information provided and makes it diffcult to access information resources. These limitations can be overridden, if the information will be provided using a homogeneous data and access model complying with the Linked Data principles. In this paper we showcase how raw Open Government Data (OGD) from heterogeneous sources can be processed, converted, published and used on the Web of Linked Data. In particular we demonstrate our experience in processing of OGD on two use cases: the Digital Agenda Scoreboard and the Financial Transparency System of the European Commission.},

The objective of the survey was to involve as many relevant stakeholders as possible in the 27 European Union countries in an online questionnaire and ask them about their needs and requirements in the area of open data as well as for the publicdata.eu portal. The main areas of the survey have been questions about Open Government Data itself, questions about data, about the usage of data, questions about the requirements for a centralised data catalogue as well as questions about the participants themselves. The goal of the OGD Stakeholder Survey has been to reach a broad audience of the main stakeholders of open data: citizens, public administration, politics and industry. In the course of the survey that was open for 5 weeks from November 2010 to December 2010 in total 329 participants completed the survey. The results have been published in April 2011 in the form of HTML and PDF, the raw data in CSV. In addition to these publication formats (HTML, PDF, CSV) we published the data also as Linked Data using various vocabularies and tools.},

abstract = {The challenge of developing information systems for rare diseases is in harmonizing social care conditions and health care conditions with the focus on personalization and patient autonomy. Knowledge about the most rare diseases is limited, which is the result of poorly funded research and the existence of only a few specialized experts. Furthermore, the treatment and care of the affected patients is very complex, cost-intensive, time critical, and involved stakeholders are very heterogeneous. The information needed by the patient depends on his or her personal situation and constitution. To support the information logistics between patients of rare diseases and (all) other stakeholders (e.g. physicians, therapists, and researchers), we developed an information system with Linked Open Data technologies in order to create a platform and tool independent solution addressing the heterogeneity of the stakeholders. To engineer system and data model requirements of our approach we analyzed the rare disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which have wide-spreaded characteristics. The resulting formal knowledge representation was encoded in OWL, which allows, for instance, a modular development of complex areas and also the re-usage of existing knowledge bases.},

abstract = {Smartphones, which contain a large number of sensors and integrated devices, are becoming increasingly powerful and fully featured computing platforms in our pockets. For many people they already replace the computer as their window to the Internet, to the Web as well as to social networks. Hence, the management and presentation of information about contacts, social relationships and associated information is one of the main requirements and features of today's smartphones. The problem is currently solved only for centralized proprietary platforms (such as Google mail, contacts & calendar) as well as data-silo-like social networks (e.g. Facebook). Within the Semantic Web initiative standards and best-practices for social, Semantic Web applications such as FOAF emerged. However, there is no comprehensive strategy, how these technologies can be used efficiently in a mobile environment. In this paper we present the architecture as well as the implementation of a mobile Social Semantic Web framework, which weaves a distributed social network based on semantic technologies.},

However, certain categories of semantically enriched content, such as multimodal documents as well as multilingual textual resources are still difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a comprehensive strategy for managing the life-cycle of both multimodal and multilingual semantically enriched content. The strategy is based on extending a number of semantic knowledge management techniques such as authoring, versioning, evolution, access and exploration for semantically enriched multimodal and multilingual content. We showcase an implementation and user interface based on the semantic wiki paradigm and present a use case from the e-tourism domain.},

abstract = {Most knowledge sources on the Data Web were extracted from structured or semi-structured data. Thus, they encompass solely a small fraction of the information available on the document-oriented Web. In this paper, we present BOA, an iterative bootstrapping strategy for extracting RDF from unstructured data. The idea behind BOA is to use the Data Web as background knowledge for the extraction of natural language patterns that represent predicates found on the Data Web. These patterns are used to extract instance knowledge from natural language text. This knowledge is finally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. We evaluate our approach on two data sets using DBpedia as background knowledge. Our results show that we can extract several thousand new facts in one iteration with very high accuracy. Moreover, we provide the first repository of natural language representations of predicates found on the Data Web.},

This diversity and heterogeneity often involve an increasing difficulty of becoming acquainted with Semantic Web technologies. In this work, we present the SPARQLTrainer approach for educating novices in semantic technologies in a playful way. With SPARQLTrainer educators can devise a SPARQL course by defining a number of exercises either generically or for a specific domain. Learners can complete courses by stepwise answering questions of increasing complexity. These questions usually require the learner to build a SPARQL query for querying a certain knowledge base and using certain SPARQL features. The SPARQL queries created by a learner are compared with example solutions given by the instructor. This comparison takes possible variations into account and gives specific feedback to the learner.},

abstract = {Although the Internet, as an ubiquitous medium for communication, publication and research, already significantly influenced the way historians work, the capabilities of the Web as a direct medium for collaboration in historic research are not much explored. We report about the application of an adaptive, semantics-based knowledge engineering approach for the development of a prosopographical knowledge base on the Web - the Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensis. In order to enable historians to collect, structure and publish prosopographical knowledge an ontology was developed and knowledge engineering facilities based on the semantic data wiki OntoWiki were implemented. The resulting knowledge base contains information about more than 14.000 entities and is tightly interlinked with the emerging Web of Data. For access and exploration by other historians a number of access interfaces were developed, such as a visual SPARQL query builder, a relationship finder and a Linked Data interface. The approach is transferable to other prosopographical research projects and historical research in general, thus improving the collaboration in historic research communities and facilitating the reusability of historic research results.},

Their users add or edit up to 150 thousand wiki pages per day. The DBpedia project extracts RDF from Wikipedia and interlinks it with other knowledge bases. In the DBpedia live extraction mode, Wikipedia edits are instantly processed to update information in DBpedia. Due to the high number of edits and the growth of Wikipedia, the update process has to be very efficient and scalable. In this paper, we present different strategies to tackle this challenging problem and describe how we modified the DBpedia live extraction algorithm to work more efficiently.},

RDFauthor completely hides syntax as well as RDF and ontology data model difficulties from end users and allows to edit information on arbitrary RDFa-annotated web pages. RDFauthor is based on extracting RDF triples from RDFa-annoted Web pages and transforming the RDFa-annotated HTML view into an editable form by using a set of authoring widgets. As a result, every RDFa-annotated web page can be made writeable, even if information originates from different sources.},

abstract = {The performance of triple stores is one of the major obstacles for the deployment of semantic technologies in many usage scenarios. In particular, Semantic Web applications, which use triple stores as persistence backends, trade performance for the advantage of flexibility with regard to information structuring. In order to get closer to the performance of relational database-backed Web applications, we developed an approach for improving the performance of triple stores by caching query results and even complete application objects. The selective invalidation of cache objects, following updates of the underlying knowledge bases, is based on analysing the graph patterns of cached SPARQL queries in order to obtain information about what kind of updates will change the query result. We evaluated our approach by extending the BSBM triple store benchmark with an update dimension as well as in typical Semantic Web application scenarios.},

Anlässlich des 600-jährigen Bestehens der Universität Leipzig wurde diese Datenbank über das Internet einem größeren Publikum zugänglich gemacht werden. Dazu wurde in Kooperation mit der Arbeitsgruppe Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) am Institut für Informatik der Universität Leipzig eine Methode und ein Werkzeug zum browsergestützten kollaborativen Sammeln und gezielten Recherchieren innerhalb des Professorenkatalogs eingesetzt. Für die Realisierung des Projeketes kommen aktuelle Technologien des Semantic Web, wie RDFS, OWL, SPARQL und Linked Open Data zum Einsatz. Vorgestellt werden das Projekt und die verwendeten Werkzeuge. Ziel des Buches ist es, Wissenschaftlern ein Muster für die Anwendung einer kollaborativen und webbasierten Methode zum Erstellen und Pflegen von Datenbanken im Internet in die Hand zu geben.},

Agiles Requirements Engineering zeichnet sich durch eine hohe Flex-ibilität und leicht-ge-wichtige Verfahren der Integration, Interaktion und Kollaboration von Stakeholdern aus. Der SoftWiki-Ansatz zielt darauf ab, möglichst viele Stakeholder möglichst unmittelbar in die Anforderungsdefinition einzubeziehen. Potenziell sehr große und räumlich getrennte Nutzergruppen werden befähigt, Software-Anforderungen zusammenzutragen, semantisch anzureichern, zu klassifizieren und zu aggregieren. Im Rahmen des SoftWiki-Projekts wurden hierfür neue methodische Unterstützungs-formen entwickelt und unter Verwendung moderner Webtechnologien umgesetzt. Es wurden aktuelle Entwicklungen in Bereichen wie Social Software, Semantic Web und agiles Wissensmanagement aufgegriffen und auf das Requirements Engineering angewandt. Evaluationen und Praxisberichte verdeutlichen das Potenzial und zukünftige Entwicklungstendenzen von agilem Requirements Engineering.},

abstract = {The DBpedia project provides Linked Data identifiers for currently 2.6 million things and serves a large knowledge base of structured information. DBpedia developed into the central interlinking hub for the Linking Open Data project, its URIs are used within named entity recognition services such as OpenCalais and annotation services such as Faviki, and the BBC started using DBpedia as their central semantic backbone. DBpedia's structured data serves as background information in the process interlinking datasets and provides a rich source of information for application developers. Beside making the DBpedia knowledge base available as linked data and RDF dumps, we offer a Lookup Service which can be used by applications to discover URIs for identifying concepts, and a SPARQL endpoint that can be retrieve data from the DBpedia knowledge base to be used in applications. This talk will give an introduction to DBpedia for web developers and an overview of DBpedia's development over the last year. We will demonstrate how DBpedia URIs are used for document annotation and how Web applications can via DBpedia facilitate Wikipedia as a source of structured knowledge.},

We start with a short introduction into Semantic Based Requirements Engineering. Then, we present an ontology for capturing requirements and related information. Based on this ontology, we describe how stakeholders are enabled to directly participate in requirements elicitation and to collaboratively create a project ontology. Finally, we report about the application of the presented approach in a use case from the egovernment domain.},
